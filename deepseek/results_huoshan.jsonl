I’m here. We’ll fix it together.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chapter One – May 22\n\nThe third stroke of her fifteenth birthday bell rang as Shi Jinxi stood on the arched balcony of the Shi family’s old mansion, watching sunlight settle like gauze over the garden lilies-of-the-valley. She had only wanted a cat, or a front-row concert ticket, but the elders insisted on turning her “coming-of-age” into a merger.\n\nA black-ebony box was opened by six sets of long, knuckled hands. Inside lay a single thin document: a 100 % equity-transfer agreement for Times Fengjun, her father’s bold signature already on the last page, waiting only for her to add the day’s date.\n\n“Little Jin, from now on every light in this building answers to you,” said the eldest Jiang son, voice coaxing yet boardroom-certain.\n\nShe hesitated half a second; the nib touched paper, ink burst into a black butterfly—her first disaster, and the exact moment her life forked.\n\n...\n\nThe next afternoon, Times Fengjun HQ, A-city financial district.\n\nOn the 37th-floor ring-corridor, three generations of artists were told to attend an “emergency meeting,” notice given just forty minutes earlier. When the lift doors opened, the air mixed fir-scented diffuser with the boys’ own soda-pop smell. First-gen Wang Junkai tugged his cap lower; Ding Chengxin was adjusting Yaoxuan’s in-ear behind his back; third-gen Zhu Zhixin stood on tiptoe peering through glass—everyone guessing whether the new boss was a bald tycoon or some fun-loving rich kid.\n\nThen the conference door swung open.\n\nShi Jinxi wore a white shirt and gray-plaid pleated skirt; a silver-moon cufflink flashed at each oversized sleeve, making her look thinner. The secretary pulled out the high-back chair; she didn’t sit. Her gaze swept the room, voice soft yet enough to silence dozens of boys at once.\n\n“Hello, I’m Shi Jinxi.”  \nShe paused two beats, as if checking she’d pronounced it right. “Just here to put faces to names. From now on… let’s look after one another.”\n\nOfficial script ended there. She tilted her head, murmured “everyone out” to the secretaries; the instant the glass door clicked shut, the chill around her cracked like thin ice.\n\nShe spun and flung herself at Zuo Hang standing in the back row.\n\n“Hang-jaaaang—”  \nThe syllable stretched soft and long, like Chongqing summer ice-cream melting. “Long time no see.”\n\nSixteen-year-old Zuo Hang staggered half a step, the back of his hand brushing the curtain, raising a puff of dust. Instinctively he cradled the back of her head, voice low, helplessly fond: “Little imp, long time no see. First day back and you’re my boss?”\n\nThe whole conference table became a frozen amusement park. Some boys gaped, others pinched each other; even steady Junkai raised an eyebrow. Nobody expected the rumored “ice-queen shareholder” and a third-gen trainee to be old friends—nor expected the boy she cuddled up to be Zuo Hang.\n\nJinxi buried her face in his shoulder, voice muffled like drizzly rain: “I think I made the wrong wish… and now I’ve made a mess.”\n\nZuo Hang patted her back, smoothing a startled cat. The boys saw his ear tips redden, yet his tone stayed sure: “Doesn’t matter. I’ll face it with you, fix it with you.”\n\nOutside the floor-to-ceiling windows, sunset ignited the clouds, washing the white wall blood-red like silent fireworks. No one spoke, yet some secret pact seemed to seal the air—\n\nFrom this second on, Times Fengjun was no longer only their battlefield; it became a fifteen-year-old’s adventure island. And the boys’ destinies, brushed once by a black butterfly’s wing, now sailed toward an uncharted route."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Continue to the next chapter.\n\nShi Jinyu: Let’s set the rules first.  \n1. From now on, you can skip any cocktail party, gala, or social event you don’t want to attend—just walk out or don’t show up at all. If the investors ask, tell them it’s my call. I may be young, but my backers aren’t small or few; they won’t dare offend me. If a brand won’t give you an endorsement, I’ll summon someone to get you a better one as compensation.  \n2. The moment sasaengs or proxy photographers mess with your life, notify Legal—lawyer letters fly, lawsuits filed.  \n3. Leak anyone’s private schedule and you’re fired plus sued for damages.  \n4. Stages and concerts: if the plan is solid and legal, I’ll approve it—anniversary or not—so long as the quality is there.  \n5. You pick the city, the theme, the set list; once you decide, my people negotiate and design.  \n6. Company team-building trips on the regular, fully expensed; you’re there to relax.  \n7. Malicious rumors, smears, or abuse—even online—collect the evidence, we sue.  \n8. If some senior throws weight around and bullies you, tell us; we’ll pull the company out of the event.  \n9. Health and safety first, mental included. Therapists are on 24-hour standby. Feel off? Go talk. Ignore your health and I’ll freeze your schedule until you’re better. Pull an all-nighter, we confiscate every last snack.\n\nIn the era when even the ancestors fear the seniors, Zuo Hang—ignoring that his elders are right there—adds a tenth rule.\n\nZuo Hang: Then add this: every time you stay up or do anything bad for your health, dock one of my stages.\n\nShi Jinyu: ?? No way!! Are you insane? What’s it got to do with you? I’m the boss here, Hang-jian, you’re reversing heaven and earth!\n\nZuo Hang: Little one, apart from this—apart from your health—I’ll let you have your way on everything. Objection overruled. One all-nighter or one unhealthy move, I lose a stage. Non-negotiable.\n\nShi Jinyu: Hang-jian, can’t we talk it over? Let’s scrap this one.\n\nZuo Hang: No deal. Keep bargaining and I’ll email Planning right now to cancel every stage I have next month.\n\nShi Jinyu: Fine!!! Enforced it is.\n\nShe puffs up like a blowfish, helpless; the boys bite back laughter.\n\nAfter sulking, she resigns herself and keeps arranging.\n\nShi Jinyu: Your schedules next week are cleared.

By the eighth rule, spines were already ramrod-straight, ready to bark, “Yes, boss, mission guaranteed!”  \nThen the ninth rule dropped—and the tone flipped.\n\n“…a psychologist on 24-hour call. Anyone who pulls an all-nighter loses every last snack. Confiscated.”\n\nThree seconds of silence, then a collective groan:\n\n“Nooo—my spicy sticks!”  \n“Even midnight snacks, boss?!”  \n“I request a safe in your office for my stash—password known only to me!”\n\nHands on hips, Jinyu wore a “I-am-the-emperor” smirk. Just as she opened her mouth to ban bubble tea too, Zuo Hang raised a hand. His voice wasn’t loud, but it sliced through the noise—\n\n“Rule ten.”  \nHe stepped forward, palm flat on the table, gaze crossing half the room to land on her. “If you stay up once, or do anything bad for your health, I lose one stage.”\n\nIt was like someone hit pause.\n\nHeads swiveled, eyes ping-ponging between them:  \n—WTF, Zuo Hang’s lost it?  \n—He’s threatening the boss?  \n—And the little boss can’t do squat?!\n\nJinyu froze for half a second, cheeks puffing into a puffer-fish face. “??? No way!!!”  \nSlap—she smacked the table. “Are you insane? What’s it to you? I’M the boss! Hang-juan, you’re reversing the natural order!”\n\nZuo Hang lowered his eyes, voice calm: “Ya-er, I let you have everything except your health—so—”  \nHe gently wrapped her small fist, still pressed to the table, inside his hand. “Objection overruled. Keep bargaining and I email the planners to cancel every stage next month.”\n\n“You wouldn’t!”  \n“I would.”  \n“…”\n\nLike a punctured balloon, she deflated, muttering, “Fine, we’ll do it…”\n\nThe onlookers exploded:  \nDing Chengxin buried his face in Song Yaxuan’s shoulder, shaking;  \nLiu Yaowen gave Zuo Hang a thumbs-up: “Bro Hang, role model!”  \nZhu Zhixin secretly typed into the “Third-Gen Underground” group:  \n【Zuo Hang publicly threatens boss—and wins!!!】\n\nEars red, Jinyu coughed and yanked the meeting back on track. “Enough!

Company retreat: Xishuangbanna, Lijiang, Dali—seven days, six nights.”\n\n“All expenses covered. Flight tomorrow 10 a.m., private jet—don’t be late.”  \n“Theme—”  \nShe bared tiny canines: “Relax, rest, and… Snack-Confiscation Supervision kicks off!”\n\nGroans rattled the ceiling.\n\nAmid the chaos, Zuo Hang secretly hooked her pinky with his and whispered, “Ya-er, I’ll watch you sleep. No midnight bubble-tea heists.”\n\nShe shot him a fierce wink: “You watch, I dock your stage.”  \n“Fine,” he smiled. “Dock one and I’ll sing ‘Happy Birthday’ for you in public—off-key.”  \n“…dirty move!”\n\nOutside, early-summer sun coated the glass, gilding everyone inside.  \nNone of them knew what unexpected chapters this “relaxing” seven-day, six-night voyage would write—  \nbut right then the boys just cheered, a band of adventurers clutching fresh tickets, ready to sail."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Continue to generate the next chapter."}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

She squinted up at the sky—the clouds here were low and fluffy, like cotton candy you could almost reach out and grab.  \n“Everyone, listen up!” She clapped her hands. “The hotel’s arranged, but the rooms are assigned by draw. No complaints!”\n\nA staff member held out a bamboo tube filled with wooden sticks.  \nEach stick was carved with a room number.\n\nWang Junkai drew first—Room 301, a single suite.  \nYi Yangqianxi got 302, also a single.  \nWhen it was Zuo Hang’s turn, he pulled out a stick marked “303—Double Room.”\n\nBefore he could react, Jinyu snatched the stick from his hand and waved it triumphantly.  \n“Perfect! I’ll room with Hang-jian!”  \nShe blinked at the stunned staff. “What? The boss can’t share a room with an artist? We’re childhood friends—it’s fine!”\n\nZuo Hang rubbed his temples, a helpless smile tugging at his lips.  \n“Ya-er…”  \n“Objection overruled!” She stuck out her tongue. “Rule ten hasn’t kicked in yet—I haven’t stayed up!”\n\nThe others exchanged glances, suppressing laughter.  \nNo one dared challenge the little boss’s “tyranny.”\n\n...\n\nThe resort was nestled deep in the rainforest, each villa built on stilts, connected by winding wooden walkways.  \nRoom 303 had floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a private infinity pool, the water blending seamlessly with the distant green mountains.\n\nAs soon as they entered, Jinyu kicked off her shoes and flopped onto the oversized bed.  \n“Ahhh—finally!”  \nShe rolled over and fixed her eyes on Zuo Hang, who was neatly unpacking his suitcase.  \n“Hang-jian, be honest—did you rig the draw?”\n\nHe didn’t look up, carefully hanging his clothes in the closet.  \n“If I’d rigged it, I’d have gotten a single room.”  \n“Liar.” She propped her chin on her hands. “You carved all the sticks last night—I saw the wood shavings in the practice room trash.”\n\nZuo Hang’s hands paused.  \nThen he turned, leaning against the closet door, arms crossed.  \n“So you were spying on me?”  \n“I was checking if anyone was secretly practicing!” She sat up, cross-legged. “But never mind that—why a double room?”\n\nHe walked over, sat on the edge of the bed, and flicked her forehead.  \n“Because someone promised at age seven that if we ever traveled together, we’d share a room so we could chat all night.”  \nHe lowered his voice. “Have you forgotten, Ya-er?”\n\nJinyu’s eyes widened.  \nThat was… the summer before first grade, when the Zuo family came to the Shi estate for a banquet. The two children hid in the garden gazebo, pinky-swearing under the moonlight.  \nShe’d thought he’d forgotten.\n\n“I…” Her ears grew hot. “I remember.”  \n“Good.” He stood up. “Rest a bit. Dinner’s at six—barbecue by the pool.”\n\n...\n\nThe barbecue party kicked off as the sun began to set.  \nPork belly sizzled on the grill, corn roasted in foil, and the boys competed to see who could flip skewers without dropping them.\n\nJinyu sat at a round table, diligently compiling a “Midnight Snack Blacklist” on her tablet.  \nSuddenly, a plate of perfectly grilled beef skewers appeared before her.  \nShe looked up to see Zuo Hang, apron tied around his waist, sleeves rolled up to reveal lean forearms.\n\n“Eat.” He sat down beside her. “I didn’t add much chili.”  \n“You remembered I can’t handle spice?” She picked up a skewer, blowing on it.  \n“I remember everything.” His voice was soft.\n\nAcross the pool, Yao Jingyuan elbowed Chen Sixu.  \n“Hey, look—our third-gen trainee is feeding the boss. Should we report him for currying favor?”  \nChen Sixu shoved a mushroom into his mouth. “Shh—if the boss hears, she’ll make you do 100 push-ups.”\n\nAs night fell, someone brought out a guitar.  \nWang Yuan strummed a few chords, and slowly, voices joined in—a medley of their group’s songs, then random pop hits, and finally, a terribly off-key rendition of “Happy Birthday.”\n\nJinyu laughed so hard she nearly choked.  \nZuo Hang gently patted her back, whispering, “This is what happens if you stay up—I’ll sing this every day.”  \n“You’re evil!” She punched his arm, but her eyes were curved like crescent moons.\n\nAt ten o’clock, she stood up and clapped.  \n“Alright! Curfew! Everyone back to your rooms—lights out by eleven!”  \nGroans erupted.  \n“Boss, it’s only ten!”  \n“We’re on vacation!”\n\nHands on hips, she declared, “Rule nine—health first! Tomorrow we’re hiking in the rainforest. Anyone who’s tired gets extra vocal practice!”  \nThe threat worked. The boys scattered like startled birds.\n\nBack in Room 303, Jinyu took the first shower.  \nWhen she emerged in pajamas, her hair wrapped in a towel, Zuo Hang was sitting on the balcony, looking at the starry sky.\n\n“Aren’t you going to shower?” She sat beside him.  \n“In a bit.” He pointed at the sky. “Look—the stars here are brighter than in Chongqing.”\n\nShe followed his gaze. The Milky Way stretched across the night sky like a spilled diamond necklace.  \nFor a while, neither spoke.  \nOnly the chirping of insects and the distant murmur of the stream filled the air.\n\n“Hang-jian.”  \n“Hmm?”  \n“Do you think… I’m doing okay as boss?” Her voice was unusually small.  \nHe turned to look at her. The moonlight caught the droplets on her hair, glistening like pearls.  \n“You’re doing great.”  \n“But I’m only fifteen. Everyone else’s bosses are at least thirty…”  \n“Age doesn’t matter.” He reached out and gently tightened the towel around her head. “What matters is that you care about them. And they know it.”\n\nShe bit her lip. “What if I mess up? What if the company loses money because of me?”  \n“Then we’ll earn it back.” His tone was firm. “Together.”\n\nJinyu stared at him, then suddenly laughed.  \n“Okay! Then tomorrow, I’ll announce a new project!”  \n“What project?”  \n“Secret!” She jumped up and ran inside. “Go shower! I’m going to bed!”\n\nZuo Hang watched her dive under the covers, a smile lingering at the corner of his mouth.  \nHe knew that smile—it meant she was up to something.\n\nSure enough, as he stepped out of the bathroom, he saw her tablet still glowing on the nightstand.  \nThe screen showed a document titled:  \n“**‘Summer Wind’ Collaborative EP Proposal—All Generations Joint Project**.”\n\nBelow it was a hastily sketched schedule and a budget estimate that made his eyes widen.  \nHe shook his head, gently closed the tablet, and whispered to the already sleeping girl:\n\n“Dream well, little boss.”  \n“Tomorrow, we’ll make miracles happen.”\n\nOutside, the rainforest breathed softly in the night.  \nSomewhere in the distance, a night bird called—as if answering a promise yet to be kept.", "tool_calls": null}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": null}, "status": "success", "finish_reason": "stop", "tool_calls_valid": null, "last_run_at": "2026-01-28T11:37:01.619660", "duration_ms": 56600, "hash": "7b983f2c0aa6837454fab2c7e346342a"}

The reaction can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{paraffin} + \\text{oxygen} \\rightarrow \\text{carbon dioxide} + \\text{water} \\]\n\nDuring this process, oxygen is consumed, generating carbon dioxide and water vapor.

Minimal upgrade  \n   • Protein: add 1 serving milk/yogurt (250 ml) or 100 g chicken breast/fish/tofu daily.  \n   • Rainbow veg: include 1–2 dark-colored vegetables (carrot, spinach, broccoli) beyond cabbage.  \n   • Good fats: 10 g nuts or 1 tsp flaxseed oil daily for ω-3.\n\nConclusion: Replacing rice with corn is only the first step toward staple diversity; you still need extra high-quality protein, varied vegetables, and healthy fats to meet daily nutritional needs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cabbage, carrots, eggs, corn, yogurt – what daily nutrients are still missing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Using cabbage, carrot, egg, corn and yogurt as your entire daily food is already better than the old “egg + cabbage + rice,” but it still misses 3 major nutrient groups; eaten long-term, obvious gaps appear:\n\n1.

Add one portion of lean meat/fish/shrimp/soy product (≈80–100 g) to cover lysine, methionine and other essentials.\n\n2. Calcium, vitamin D and vitamin B12 still low  \n   • Yogurt is calcium-rich but has no vitamin D, so the calcium can’t be well absorbed or used.  \n   • Vitamin B12 is found only in animal foods; eggs contain very little, risking anemia long-term.  \n   → Have a small handful of low-fat cheese daily or supplement 400 IU vitamin D and 2 µg B12.\n\n3. Essential fatty acids and trace elements missing  \n   • ω-3 (DHA/EPA) absent: corn and yogurt have virtually none.  \n   • Iron & zinc: plant iron is poorly absorbed; need 50 g red meat/deep-sea fish or a small handful of dried oysters.  \n   • Iodine: without sea salt or seaweed, thyroid problems can arise.\n\nOne-sentence wrap-up  \n“Cabbage + carrot + egg + corn + yogurt” covers most vitamins A, C, B1, B2, but still falls short on total protein, vitamins D/B12, calcium absorption, ω-3 fats, iron, zinc and iodine.

Integers within a specified range (inclusive)\n```excel\n=RANDBETWEEN(lower, upper)\n```\n**Example:**\n```excel\n=RANDBETWEEN(1, 100)\n```\n- Produces an **integer** from 1 to 100, including both 1 and 100.  \n- Also **volatile**; changes when the sheet refreshes.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 3. Decimals within a specified range (non-integer)\nTo create, say, a 2-decimal number between 5 and 10:\n```excel\n=ROUND(RAND() * (10 - 5) + 5, 2)\n```\n- Logic: `RAND() * (upper - lower) + lower`  \n- Use `ROUND` to set decimal places.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 4. Non-repeating random integers (advanced)\nTo pull, for example, 10 unique integers from 1 to 100:\n\n1. In column A enter `=RAND()` as a helper.  \n2. In column B use `=RANK(A1, A:A)` to get ranks.  \n3. The first 10 ranks are your unique random numbers.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Notes:\n- All these functions are **volatile**; they refresh on every sheet change.  \n- To **lock** the generated numbers, copy the cells (`Ctrl + C`) → paste as **Values** (`Ctrl + V` → choose “Values”).\n\n---\n\nWant me to build you a template?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I want to generate random decimals"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Below are the 3 most common “generate random decimal” formulas—copy them straight into Excel.

While writing, he let his brush gallop freely, following his heart, yet never overstepped the rules; orderly, natural, gathered without crowding or chaos, released without excess or drift. In brush movement he gave full play to the strength within each stroke, yet the expression remained reserved, hidden rather than flaunted.  \n\nWang Duo’s running script tilts left-low right-high, tight in the middle, large on top and small below, the four corners comparatively open, especially the final strokes at the lower left, lower right and tail, all displaying a free character. The last vertical is often written slanted, right-leaning or left-leaning, sometimes even curved, revealing surging emotion. He emphasizes horizontal momentum, spreading left and right. Of course, he keeps release within measure, expansion within control.  \n\nIn character structure he is expansive yet gathered, danger seen within uprightness. Character size, length, width, square-round, straight-slant, fat-thin vary endlessly; every single structure is in flux—this is a hallmark of his calligraphy.  \n\nIn overall layout he pays attention not only to the seeming slant yet real uprightness of single characters, manipulating the relations among components, but also treats several characters, one line, or an entire piece as a unit, handling such slant-upright variation. Each character appears to tilt and wobble, yet through mutual adjustment among characters, the staggered undulation of line alignment, and the black-white handling within, between, and among lines, balance and harmony are restored. Added to this, Wang Duo’s running script often contains cursive script; the fusion creates rising-falling, opposites-unified effects, still more unfettered and varied. In this art of treatment he reached true perfection.  \n\nWang Duo created lines suited to his style: his brush is multifaceted—square-round, straight-side, elegant yet fierce, spreading-twisting, breaking-gathering, nothing impossible; lines blend firm and soft, softness within firmness, soft yet forceful, giving a sense of resilient inner strength. Thick-thin contrasts are apt: some like ancient vines’ old trunks, some like new shoots hanging over cliffs, dancing in the wind; within the beautiful picture emerges a poetic, song-like mood.  \n\nHis ink moves from wet to dry, dry to parched, from richest to palest, from swollen to thirsty, moist and dry alternating, used with perfect rhythm. He successfully employed the “swollen-ink” method, letting ink flow and swell to glue strokes into planes, simplifying form and avoiding fussiness, while creating plane-line contrasts that heighten expression and enhance the work’s spirit.  \n\nNo imitation can reach the realm of Wang Duo’s calligraphy. Forgers, fearing inexactness, hold their brush timidly, rigidly regular, afraid to let go; or they deliberately twist, producing awkwardness; or their strokes are stiff, especially at turning points, overly mechanical. A final vertical often lacks strength and fails to gather; a final slash or flick is often light and slippery. When several such strokes appear, their forms are identical, devoid of variation. Fakes often knot and distort at structural turns; strokes are either over-forced, harsh and harsh, or under-forced, shallow and weak—far from the thick, raw vitality of the genuine.  \n\n4. Character usage and signature seals  \n\nAncient masters, erudite and learned, often used rare and variant characters; some forms were unique, Wang Duo being no exception.  \n\nSome current simplified characters were earlier variants or cursive forms, so identical forms in ancient calligraphy are unsurprising.  \n\nWang Duo liked relatively simplified variants. Some shared radicals with today’s simplified forms: e.g. “speech” radical simplified to “讠”, “gate” radical to “门”, “bed” radical to “丬”. Examples: 语, 诵, 诸, 谢, 诚; 问; 将.  \n\nOthers matching simplified forms: 与, 绿, 气, 险, 来, 尔, 栖.  \n\nSome were then-current cursive or rare forms: e.g. 度 written as , 西 as , 渔 as , 法 as , 受 as , 雷 as , 契 as , 原 as , 思 as , 农 as , 蛇 as , 蟪 as . He once wrote 刘 as 馏—rarely recognized even at the time.  \n\nWang Duo’s signatures appear mostly in cursive, less in running script. Signatures are the easiest tell: genuine ones are fluent and natural; forgers, though deliberate, always appear awkward, especially cursive signatures, like dead snakes writhing. Some fakers, unclear about stroke direction, twist randomly, unsightly.  \n\nHis seals include: 王铎之印, 觉斯, 王铎, 宗伯之章, 大宗伯印, 觉斯父, 烟潭渔叟, 大学士章, etc.", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a previous search result, I noticed a link [^8^] to the “Wang Duo Calligraphy Dictionary,” which includes the character “涛.” Wang Duo was a renowned calligrapher of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, celebrated for his running-cursive script; his style should offer valuable reference for the running-script form of “涛” in “王竟涛.” I will therefore visit that link to see if I can locate an image of “涛” in running script, providing you with a more direct visual reference.", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "id": "functions.urls_fetch_tool:2", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "arguments": "{\"urls\": [\"http://www.guoxuedashi.com/2196/\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "URL: http://www.guoxuedashi.com/2196/\nTitle: _Guoxue Master\nContent: About Us | Add to Favorites | Submissions Welcome | Comments & Suggestions | Guoxue Fan\n\nCopyright © Guoxue Master Classical Books Integration All Rights Reserved.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a non-profit site.

They pledged to start with themselves, put “Cherish Food, Refuse Waste” into practice, and be advocates of civilized living.

Listed by period and author for easy reference; each is followed by a one-line cue to its color and feeling.\n\n1. Sky-Clear Sand · Autumn Thoughts  \n   Ma Zhiyuan  \n   Withered vines, old tree, dusk crows; small bridge, running water, homestead; ancient road, west wind, lean horse. Sun slants west: heart-broken man at sky’s edge.  \n   Cue: Twenty-eight characters paint “autumn dusk of a wanderer,” hailed as the ancestor of all autumn laments.\n\n2. Sky-Clear Sand · Autumn (also titled simply Autumn)  \n   Bai Pu  \n   Lonely village, setting sun, fading rose clouds; thin smoke, old tree, cold crows; one wild-goose shadow drops. Blue hills, green waters, white grass, red leaves, yellow flowers.  \n   Cue: From bleak to brilliant, a color-soaked autumn diptych.\n\n3. Sky-Clear Sand · Autumn  \n   Zhu Tingyu  \n   Before the court, every phoenix-tree leaf has fallen; by the water, lotus blooms are fully open—sharing the poet’s mood. Frosted leaves leave their branch and fly to me for a red-ink inscription.  \n   Cue: Parlor trees versus pond blooms, garden autumn’s solitude and refinement.\n\n4. Great-Virtue Song · Autumn  \n   Guan Hanqing  \n   Wind flutters, rain spits; even the sleep-immortal Chen Tuan could not doze…Autumn cicadas finish, cold crickets begin; a fine thin drizzle taps the plantain.  \n   Cue: Rain, insect, plantain—each sound a stroke of autumn-night fretwork.\n\n5. Clear-River Refrain · Autumn Heart  \n   Zhang Kejiu  \n   West wind brings word from home ten thousand li, asking my return date. Wild geese cry beneath red-leaf skies; drunk on yellow-flower ground, I dream to the sound of rain on plantain.  \n   Cue: West wind, homing goose, yellow chrysanthemum, plantain—every line adds another layer of homesick autumn.\n\n6. Clear-River Refrain · Autumn Dwelling  \n   Wu Xiyi  \n   White geese scatter like autumn snow; clear dew chills the night…Star-brimming sky—man asleep.  \n   Cue: Geese as snow, dew as frost, a traveler under star-river—cool, crisp, free.\n\n7. Drunk in East Wind · Autumn Scene  \n   Lu Zhi  \n   On sheer cliff, a withered pine leans upside-down; with falling afterglow, lone wild duck wings level…Carry me inside a Xiao-Xiang scroll.  \n   Cue: Mountain, water, sunset, duck—cinematic “autumn boat on Xiao-Xiang.”\n\n8.

Today I want to use this PPT to tell you why I’m running—not to be a “high-up cadre,” but to be the teammate who reaches out and gets things done.\n\nSlide 2: About Me  \nCopy  \n- Basics: XXX | Suzhou, Jiangsu | Major XX Class XX | Communist Youth League member  \n- Tags: Ice-breaker · Ready helper · Closer  \n- Track record: As high-school class president, compiled a “Hobby Handbook” for 32 classmates so we clicked within a week; for two weeks straight I typed up math notes for a sick classmate and checked his progress daily so he didn’t fall behind.  \n\nImage  \n- Left third: round cropped smiling photo, light-blue border.  \n- Right two-thirds: top—basics & color-box tags; bottom—bullet points starting with ✅.  \n\nScript  \n(pointing at photo)  \nQuick intro: I’m from Suzhou. In high school I made that hobby handbook—suddenly guitar people found guitar people, board-game fans found board-game fans, and the room warmed up. For the sick classmate I asked “Got this part?” every day until he said “All clear,” because I finish what I start.\n\nSlide 3: My Edge  \nCopy  \n- Edge 1: Proactive – Already double-checked contact info for 15 classmates so nothing’s missing.  \n- Edge 2: Coordinator – Rescheduled three class events into staggered slots, pushing attendance from 60 % to 90 %.  \n- Edge 3: Closer – Todo-list addict; high-school class tasks 100 % done with feedback.  \n\nImage  \nThree equal columns: icon (👋 🤝 📝), bold title, one-line proof; columns tinted light gray / blue / green with rounded corners.  \n\nScript  \n(pointing)  \nThree reasons I’ll deliver: First, I proactively verified every phone number.

Paperwork Aid – 3-day “Youth League Cheat-Sheet” in group chat; 1-hour weekly office hour for one-on-one help.  \n2. Hobby Ice-Break – Interest survey this week → online 1-sentence share next week → mini offline meetups after.  \n3. Warm Touch – Friday “Weekend Tips” (library hrs, weather); reach out to anyone still quiet and offer a campus walk.  \n\nImage  \nThree vertical strips: big “1 2 3,” bold title, arrow bullets ≤10 chars each; right-side doodles (booklet, form, reminder).  \n\nScript  \n(step-by-step)  \nVote me and Month 1 looks like this: Cheat-sheet drops in 3 days, I sit every week for questions; survey goes out Friday, we Zoom-share hobbies Monday; Friday tips hit your phone, and if you feel lost, I’ll walk you to the library myself.\n\nSlide 6: Promise & Ask  \nCopy  \nPromise: Be the one who reaches first, does the thoughtful thing, builds a warm league.  \nAsk: Please vote for me—your choice will be the right one!  \nFooter: Thank you!  \n\nImage  \nLight-blue gradient, center semi-transparent emblem.  \nPromise: bold Heiti 32 pt centered; ask: red KaiTi 28 pt centered; thank-you: SimSun 24 pt centered.  \n\nScript  \n(step forward)  \nI can’t promise I know everything, but I promise I’ll always reach out first.

A段（0'19''–1'12''）：王铮亮流行男声主唱，旋律以级进为主，节奏舒缓如述；伴奏仅用弦乐pad与点状竖琴，留出大片“水面”。  \n3. B段（1'13''–2'06''）：王珮瑜京剧老生腔接入，板鼓、小锣切入，节拍由4/4转为有板无眼的散板，音区提高四度，形成“水墨中突然焦墨一笔”的戏剧张力。  \n4. 间奏（2'07''–2'34''）：琵琶轮指与电子低频对位，古今音色碰撞，暗示“时空对话”。  \n5. A'段（2'35''–3'28''）：二人交替——流行长音托住戏曲甩腔，和声上采用add4与sus2，使“水波”与“人声”叠映，情绪升至顶点。  \n6. 尾声（3'29''–4'28''）：所有打击乐抽离，古筝回到最初的动机，箫以气声渐弱，象征钓翁收竿、水天合一。\n\n三、音高与调式  \n歌曲以D宫五声调式为基底，但在B段临时转至其下属调G宫，利用“变宫为角”的模糊游移，表现“仕”与“隐”的徘徊。尾声通过微分音的箫滑音，把宫音拉回D，完成“求仕—归隐—天人合一”的闭环。\n\n四、节奏与律动  \n主歌采用“伸缩拍”（rubato），鼓组以手拍水面采样替代传统军鼓，每四拍出现一次逆波，制造“浮力”。副歌进入稳定4/4，底鼓与板鼓重音错位，形成“水波推舟”的摇摆感。\n\n五、音色与配器  \n制作团队刻意让“古”与“今”保持5:5的声量平衡：  \n古——箫、古筝、琵琶、板鼓、小锣  \n今——合成器pad、电子低音、环境采样、流行鼓组  \n混音上将古乐器定位在左右30°以内，电子声相扩展至60°，中央留下人声通道，使“山水”环“人物”，符合中国画“留白”法则。\n\n六、演唱风格  \n王铮亮用半气声与胸声混合，保持“叙述”质感；王珮瑜则以“云遮月”的老生腔，在句尾使用擞音与裂音，模拟钓线提拉的顿挫。二人交替时，流行声部常做“倚音”下行，戏曲声部做“甩音”上行，一抑一扬，恰似文王俯身、太公抬竿的画面。\n\n七、歌词意象  \n“一竿风月”“两岸青山”“白云深处有龙吟”三句，分别以“竿”“岸”“云”为支点，构成竖向空间；“渭水东流”“星斗转移”则给出横向时间。词作者用“竖空间＋横时间”的十字结构，让听众在二维画面里感知三维时空。\n\n八、整体审美  \n作品以“静水”为形，以“隐贤”为神，以“访贤”为戏剧冲突，最终落到“天人合一”的东方宇宙观。音乐上通过调式游移、节奏松紧、古今音色三层对比，把“仕”与“隐”的辩证关系化为可听的“水纹”，让典故不再是书本上的铅字，而成为耳畔流动的山水。", "name": "search", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}, {"role": "system", "content": "- Evaluate whether the returned search results fully answer the user’s question; if information is insufficient, continue calling search or other tools.  \n- Only provide the final reply after all tool calls are complete.  \n- When writing the reply: if the question is time-sensitive, use only information from the search results that is explicitly dated and whose date matches; cite any quoted web content by adding [^corresponding number^] at the end of the sentence.", "name": "resource"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

Their core distinctions can be summarized as:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Core Purpose  \n- **Heatmap**  \n  **Pattern discovery**: Uses color intensity to reveal density, frequency, or strength, helping users instantly spot anomalies, hotspots, or cold zones.  \n  *Examples*: website click heatmap (red = high-click areas), traffic flow heatmap (red = congested roads).\n\n- **Dashboard**  \n  **Real-time status monitoring**: Aggregates multi-dimensional KPIs, presenting them as charts, numbers, or progress bars that update live for rapid decision-making.  \n  *Examples*: server CPU usage, real-time sales, IoT device status panel.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Data & Time Characteristics  \n| Dimension        | Heatmap                              | Dashboard                          |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Time**         | Static or quasi-static (e.g., past 24 h aggregate) | Real-time (second/minute refresh) |\n| **Granularity**  | High-dimensional spatial data (geo, page coords) | Structured metrics (values, %, trends) |\n| **Interaction**  | Light (zoom, hover for details)      | Rich (filter, drill-down, alerts)  |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Visual Design  \n- **Heatmap**  \n  – Color mapping is central (e.g., red-yellow-green for high-med-low).  \n  – Overlaid on maps, screenshots, matrices.  \n- **Dashboard**  \n  – Mixed widgets (line charts, gauges, tables, alert lights).  \n  – Emphasizes tidy layout and info hierarchy (top-left = critical KPI).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Typical Use Cases  \n- **Heatmap**  \n  – UX optimization: analyze clicks, dwell time.  \n  – Scientific viz: gene expression, urban density.  \n- **Dashboard**  \n  – Ops monitoring: server health, network latency.  \n  – Business monitoring: live sales, inventory alerts.\n\n---\n\n### One-liner  \nA **heatmap** is the color-speaking detective; a **dashboard** is the metric-watching steward."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What does a heat map look like?"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}, "response": {"id": "0217695717663230f039f0d1ab0954afd871e23882ebffff9e61f", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1769571767, "model": "deepseek-v3-2-251201", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "A heatmap is a **color-coded grid or overlay** where colors represent the magnitude or density of data points. Here’s what one typically looks like:\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Structure**\n1. **Grid or Matrix Layout**  \n   - Often a rectangular grid of cells (like a spreadsheet or table).\n   - Each cell corresponds to a data point or category intersection.\n\n2. **Color Gradient**  \n   - Colors range from **cool** (blues/greens) for low values to **warm** (yellows/reds) for high values — or vice versa, depending on the scale.\n   - Example gradient:  \n     🔵 **Blue** → 🟢 **Green** → 🟡 **Yellow** → 🔴 **Red**  \n     (low → medium → high)\n\n3. **Axes Labels**  \n   - Rows and columns are labeled to show what each axis represents (e.g., time periods, categories, locations).\n\n4. **Optional Legend**  \n   - A color bar or scale explaining the mapping between colors and values.\n\n---\n\n### **Common Examples**\n\n#### 1. **Website Click Heatmap**\n- A semi-transparent color layer overlaid on a webpage screenshot.\n- **Red/orange** areas = high click density.  \n- **Blue/green** areas = low interaction.\n- Looks like a “thermal” snapshot of user activity.\n\n#### 2. **Correlation Matrix**\n- A square grid showing relationships between variables.\n- Each cell’s color indicates correlation strength (e.g., dark red = strong positive, dark blue = strong negative).\n\n#### 3. **Geographic Heatmap**\n- Colors painted over a map (e.g., population density, crime incidents).\n- **Hotspots** appear as glowing red zones; sparse areas as cool colors.\n\n#### 4. **Time-Series Heatmap**\n- Rows = time intervals (e.g., hours), columns = days.\n- Color intensity shows activity level (e.g., website traffic by hour/day).\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Text-Based Example**\nImagine a heatmap of weekly sales per store:\n\n| Store | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |\n|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| A     | 🟢   | 🟡   | 🔴   | 🟡   | 🟢   |\n| B     | 🔵   | 🟢   | 🟡   | 🔴   | 🟡   |\n| C     | 🟡   | 🔴   | 🔴   | 🟡   | 🟢   |\n\n🔵 = Low sales  \n🟢 = Medium  \n🟡 = High  \n🔴 = Very high\n\n---\n\n### **Why It Works**\n- **Intuitive**: Our brains quickly decode color intensity.\n- **Patterns pop**: Clusters, outliers, and trends become visually obvious.\n- **Space-efficient**: Can pack thousands of data points into one image.\n\nIn short, a heatmap turns numbers into a **colorful landscape of data** — making it easy to spot where the “heat” (activity, risk, performance) is concentrated.", "tool_calls": null}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": null}, "status": "success", "finish_reason": "stop", "tool_calls_valid": null, "last_run_at": "2026-01-28T11:43:05.832760", "duration_ms": 21670, "hash": "c1950496e332a3e9ea408231cc79fc03"}

关键调试\n    return response.json()['secretDate']  # 这里可能会报错\n```\n\n#### 2. **检查返回内容是否为空或错误页面**\n如果 `response.text` 是空字符串、HTML 错误页面、或提示“参数错误”，你需要根据实际返回内容调整逻辑。\n\n#### 3. **增加异常处理**\n避免程序崩溃，建议加上异常处理：\n\n```python\ntry:\n    encdata = res_data(frdm)\n    resdaa = decdata(encdata)\n    data = json.loads(resdaa)\n    for item in data['dataList']:\n        print(f\"{item['uscc']} {item['empname']} {item['legrepcertno']}\")\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n    print(\"❌ JSON解析失败:\", e)\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    print(\"❌ 字段缺失:\", e)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"❌ 其他错误:\", e)\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 示例：安全版代码\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef res_data(frdm):\n    url = '你的接口地址'\n    params = {'frdm': frdm}\n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        print(\"❌ 请求失败，状态码:\", response.status_code)\n        print(\"响应内容:\", response.text)\n        return None\n    try:\n        return response.json()['secretDate']\n    except (KeyError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:\n        print(\"❌ 接口返回异常:\", e)\n        print(\"响应内容:\", response.text)\n        return None\n\ndef decdata(encdata):\n    # 模拟解密函数，返回 JSON 字符串\n    return encdata  # 假设解密后就是 JSON 字符串\n\nfrdm = input('输入法人代码:')\nencdata = res_data(frdm)\nif encdata:\n    try:\n        data = json.loads(encdata)\n        for item in data['dataList']:\n            print(f\"{item['uscc']} {item['empname']} {item['legrepcertno']}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"❌ 解析失败:\", e)\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 总结\n| 问题 | 原因 | 解决方法 |\n|------|------|-----------|\n| `JSONDecodeError` | 接口返回空或非法JSON | 打印 `response.text` 查看实际内容 |\n| `KeyError: 'secretDate'` | 返回结构不对 | 检查字段名是否正确 |\n| 程序崩溃 | 没有异常处理 | 加 `try-except` |\n\n如果你能贴出 `res_data()` 的完整代码和接口返回示例，我可以帮你更具体地改。"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Python implementation of URL encoding"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "在 Python 中，可以使用标准库 `urllib.parse` 来实现 URL

If n=4, then 0 and 4 are equally likely as 1 and 3 in fair coin, but maybe recent history shows 4 is “hot” or “cold.”  \n\nGiven the “head consecutive-banker phenomenon” and “hot-cold transition” in Step 3, maybe they alternate between hot and cold numbers. If 4 heads just happened, maybe exclude it; if 4 heads hasn’t happened in a while, maybe include it.  \n\nBut since no data, the instruction says “pick the next special number” — maybe they mean:  \nFrom 0,1,2,3,4, exclude the one least probable by Bayesian posterior.  \n\nA reasonable default Bayesian guess with no data:  \nIf we imagine n=4 trials, p=0.5, the expected counts are symmetric. But maybe they think “black-hole phenomenon” means some number is due to disappear.  \n\nOften in these lottery-type systems, they exclude the **most recent** outcome if it’s extreme.  \n\n---\n\n**I’ll make a plausible guess:**  \nIf I must choose 4 out of 5, and exclude 1, and I have no data, I’d exclude the middle number 2 (because it’s most common in fair coin n=4, so maybe it’s “too ordinary” to be special).  \nBut “special number” means the one to bet on? Or exclude? The text says “pick the next special number: choose 4 heads (0–4) and exclude one” — so special number is among the 4 chosen, excluded is not special.  \n\nGiven common “hot number” tactics, maybe 3 is special lately, so exclude the coldest. Without data, I’ll assume 0 is excluded (extremely low heads rarely happens if coins are biased? Or maybe 4 is excluded).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice (arbitrary but reasoned):**  \nExclude **0 heads** (because maybe recent history shows no 0-heads events, so Bayesian update says P(0) is lowest).  \n\nSo chosen 4 heads counts: {1, 2, 3, 4}.  \nExcluded: 0.  \n\n**Answer:** Exclude 0.", "tool_calls": null}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": null}, "status": "success", "finish_reason": "stop", "tool_calls_valid": null, "last_run_at": "2026-01-28T11:44:43.984391", "duration_ms": 31034, "hash": "532dd54b8ad128b4cf3d00e0a3dc66f3"}

The GPU’s role is to handle all visual-related tasks, such as video games, videos, etc., while the CPU handles almost everything else.\n\nWith so many processors available on the market and various price ranges, finding the suitable one is never uncomplicated.\n\nTo ensure that anybody reading this article makes an informed decision, we have created this **hierarchy of CPUs** from the recent few generations to help you determine what you require.\n\nWe are ranking the CPUs in tiers based on their performance in gaming and productivity.\n\nWithout further delay, here is the final CPU hierarchy list!\n\nNote: Intel’s 12th-gen CPUs have P (performance), E (effective), and T (threads) indicators under Cores/Threads\n\nTable of ContentsShow\n\n1.  S Tier\n\n2.  A Tier\n\n3.  B Tier\n\n4.  C Tier\n\n5.  D Tier\n\n6.  Final Words On The CPU Hierarchy\n\nThe **premium** is where the most potent and costly processors belong. These CPUs are for users wanting to **enhance their FPS** in the most visually challenging games or to do **complex work**.\n\nTo achieve top-notch productivity, consider the third-gen Threadripper. It provides exceptional price-to-performance value. One model, the Threadripper 3990X, boasts 64 cores and costs $4000.\n\nAlternatively, the **Threadripper 3960X** is priced at **$1,400** with 24 cores and 48 threads. If you are searching for an Intel solution, the i9-10980XE has 18 cores/ 36 threads at $1000. We wouldn’t suggest these for gaming, though.\n\nTo obtain exceptional quality and favorable bargains, consider Intel’s high-grade processors like the i9-13900K, i7-13700K, and i5-13600K. They are priced at $589, $409, and $319, respectively. The 12th gen SKUs are also a wise option.\n\nAMD also offers outstanding gaming performance for a fair value with the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, Ryzen 7 7700X, and Ryzen 5 7600X.\n\nHowever, AMD’s Ryzen non-X CPUs like the **Ryzen 9 7900**, **Ryzen 7 7700**, and **Ryzen 5 7600** have an even more outstanding price-to-performance ratio.\n\nThe recently released **Ryzen 9 7950X3D** and **Ryzen 7 7800X3D** are the fastest gaming CPUs in the world, followed closely by the **Ryzen 9 7900X3D**.\n\nThe rest of the Ryzen 7000 series, like the **Ryzen 9 7900X** and **Ryzen 9 7950X**, are also reliable options, especially if you’re leaning toward creative work.\n\nAMD’s **Ryzen 5950X**, **5900X,** and **5700X** are also quite fast CPUs, so they deserve this S-tier classification. The MSRPs are $799, $549, and $299 respectively.\n\n### Gaming\n\n||Model|Boost Clock|Cores/Threads|TDP|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|1.|Ryzen 7 7800X3D|5.0 GHz|8/16|120W|\n|2.|Ryzen 9 7950X3D|5.7 GHz|16/32|120W|\n|3.|Ryzen 9 7900X3D|5.6 GHz|12/24|120W|\n|4.|Intel Core i9-13900K/KS|5.8 GHz|8P/16E/32T|125W|\n|5.|Ryzen 7 7700X|5.4 GHz|8/12|105W|\n|6.|Intel Core i7-13700K|5.4 GHz|8P/8E/24T|125W|\n|7.|Ryzen 9 7950X|5.7 GHz|16/32|170W|\n|8.|Ryzen 9 7900X|5.6 GHz|12/24|170W|\n|9.|Ryzen 5 7600X|5.3 GHz|6/12|105W|\n|10.|Ryzen 9 7900|5.4 GHz|12/24|65W|\n|11.|Ryzen 7 7700|5.3 GHz|8/16|65W|\n|12.|Ryzen 5 7600|5.1 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|13.|Ryzen 7 5800X3D|4.8 GHz|8/16|105W|\n|14.|Intel Core i5-13600K|5.1 GHz|6P/8E/20T|125W|\n|16.|Intel Core i9-12900KS|5.5 GHz|8P/8E/24T|150W|\n|17.|_Intel Core i9-12900K_|5.2 GHz|8P/8E/24T|125W|\n|18.|_AMD Ryzen 9 5950X_|4.9 GHz|16/32|105W|\n|19.|_IntelCore i7-12700K_|5.0 GHz|8P/4E/20T|125W|\n\n**P – Performance cores, E – Efficiency cores, T – Threads**## A Tier\n\nThe A-tier of CPUs consists of recent and older generation CPUs that do not cost an arm and a leg and have a diminished core count.\n\nHere, we have the **Ryzen 5 5600X** and the **Ryzen 5 5600** competing against Intel’s **i5-11600K**. Both of these CPUs are similarly priced and have 6 cores/12 threads. They are also considerably cheaper than S-tier CPUs at around $300.\n\nHowever, the Ryzen 5 5600 is a significantly superior affordable choice as it only costs **$200**.\n\nThe Ryzen **5700G** and **5600G** (AMD’s processors with built-in graphics) can also be positioned here, just under the **i9-10900**.\n\nWe also have the processors from two generations ago, the **10700K** and **10900K**.\n\nAMD’s third generation also deserves a place in the top tier. Particularly the Ryzen 3900X and 3700X variants.\n\nIntel’s i3-12100F might appear as simply another i3 with 8 threads only, but it actually performs quite exceptionally, exchanging blows with the 11400F, 3700X, and extra CPUs.## A Tier\n\nWe also have the processors from two generations ago, the **10700K** and **10900K**.\n\nAMD’s third generation also deserves a place in the top tier.

Don’t be mistaken; the processors in this category are still more than capable of handling modern games and outputting competitive FPS. Second-tier processors might provide the ideal price-per-performance of all these options.\n\nThe Ryzen 3600 was and possibly still is one of AMD’s most cherished processors. A processor with 12 threads and reasonable power consumption sold for just $200. How can someone not adore it?\n\nThese days, you could probably obtain the 3600 or even the **3600X** for as little as $180.\n\nRyzen 3600, one of AMD’s most valued CPUs.\n\nSome of Intel’s 9th-generation CPUs also fit here flawlessly. The **9900K** and even the 8-thread **9700K** are still sufficient enough. Of course, this is at a much cheaper price than MSRP.\n\n||Model|Boost Clock|Cores/Threads|TDP|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|1.|_IntelCore i9-9900K_|5.0 GHz|8/16|95W|\n|2.|_IntelCore i7-9700K_|4.9 GHz|8/8|95W|\n|3.|_Intel Core i9-9900_|5.0 GHz|8/16|65W|\n|4.|_Intel Core i7-9700_|4.7 GHz|8/8|65W|\n|5.|_AMD Ryzen 5 5500_|4.2 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|6.|_AMD Ryzen 5 3600X_|4.4 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|7.|_AMD Ryzen 5 3600_|4.2 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|8.|_AMD Ryzen 3 3300X_|4.3 GHz|4/8|95W|\n|9.|_IntelCore i5-9600K_|4.6 GHz|6/6|95W|## C Tier\n\nWe have entered the group of processors that are starting to reveal their age, shortage of cores, and power, especially when it comes to the latest video games.\n\nAMD’s second generation of Ryzen still provides exceptional value, but its IPC is rather mediocre, leaving a lot to be desired. The same goes for Intel’s 9th generation i5s and i3s.\n\nThe Ryzen **2700X** is a reasonably solid option as you can grab it for less than $200 and get an 8-core and 16-thread CPU.

Below is a systematic overview covering principles, deployment, configuration, usage, security, and “availability in mainland China”.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n1. Principles & Features  \n- Built on TLS/SSL (same stack as HTTPS), supports UDP/TCP, default ports 1194/443.  \n- Hybrid encryption: symmetric (AES/ChaCha20) + asymmetric (RSA/ECC); works with X.509 certs, user/pass, or 2FA.  \n- Fully open-source, auditable; highly modular with pluggable compression, obfuscation, traffic-shaping plugins.  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n2.

Performance & Reliability Tuning  \n| Scenario | Tip |\n|---|---|\n| High loss/latency | Switch to TCP-443 + `explicit-exit-notify 0` |\n| High throughput | Use `cipher AES-256-GCM` + `ncp-disable` |\n| Many clients | Enable `duplicate-cn` (testing) or `client-config-dir` |\n| DNS leak | Push `dhcp-option DNS [IP_ADDRESS]` & add `block-outside-dns` (Win) |\n| Reconnect | Client: `resolv-retry infinite` / `persist-tun` / `keepalive 10 60` |\n\n------------------------------------------------\n5. Security Hardening  \n- Certs: separate root CA & server, private keys `chmod 600`; per-client certs, disable `duplicate-cn` in prod.  \n- Transport: always enable `tls-auth` or `tls-crypt`; TLS ≥ 1.2, prefer 1.3.  \n- Auth: add PAM/LDAP + Google Authenticator (2FA).  \n- PFS: DH ≥ 2048-bit or ECDH (`ecdh-curve prime256v1`).  \n- Rotation: 1-year cert lifetime, update CRL/OCSP instantly.  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n6. Mainland China Availability & Work-arounds  \n- Native OpenVPN (UDP 1194) is **instantly blocked** by GFW; TCP 443 lasts longer but still probed.  \n- Practical tricks:  \n  1. Wrap in TLS tunnel: stunnel on server exposes 443, looks like HTTPS.  \n  2. Obfuscation plugins: obfs4, v2ray-plugin, Snell.  \n  3. Dynamic ports: change daily and email users.  \n- Mobile: iOS VPN API weak, obfs drains battery; Android with “OpenVPN for Android”+plugin still less stable than WireGuard/V2Ray.  \n- Verdict: **OpenVPN “works” but “works poorly”** in China; for circumvention prefer Trojan+TLS or V2Ray+XTLS. Use OpenVPN only when compatibility is mandatory (remote office, returning employee) and apply above camouflage.  \n\n------------------------------------------------\nOne-sentence summary  \nOpenVPN is mature, secure, and cross-platform, but its bulk and traffic fingerprint are liabilities in heavily censored regions; ideal for overseas remote work and corporate intranets, yet for “wall-climbing” wrap it in stunnel/obfs4 or switch to lighter WireGuard/Trojan."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Shadowsocks + v2ray"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "functions.search:1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "search", "arguments": "{\"queries\":[\"Shadowsocks 和 V2Ray 集成\",\"Shadowsocks 配置 V2Ray 代理\",\"Shadowsocks 和 V2Ray 使用教程\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Historical tool_call results have been hidden", "name": "search", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "下面给出 2025 年最常用、实测可用的 **“Shadowsocks + v2ray-plugin”** 完整思路：  \n从「原理 → 服务端 → 客户端 → 性能/抗封 → 一键脚本」五个维度一次讲清，照着抄命令 10 min 就能跑通。  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n1. 原理与角色  \n- Shadowsocks（ss-rust 版）负责「轻量加密 + SOCKS5 入口」，资源占用极低。  \n- v2ray-plugin 负责「流量伪装 + 传输层混淆」，把 ss 流量套进 WebSocket+TLS，外观等同于 HTTPS 网页流量，GFW 识别难度最大。  \n- 两者通过本地 Unix socket 或 [IP_ADDRESS] 回环通信，对外只暴露 443 端口，Nginx/Caddy 做 TLS 终结。  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n2. 服务端 5 步速成（Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 通用）  \n```bash\n# 0) 准备域名（必须）  假设域名  ss.example.com  已解析到服务器\n# 1) 安装 acme.sh 签免费证书\ncurl https://get.acme.sh | sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\nacme.sh --issue -d ss.example.com --standalone\n\n# 2) 装 Nginx 并配置 TLS 反代\napt install nginx -y\nmkdir /etc/nginx/ssl\nacme.sh --install-cert -d ss.example.com \\\n        --key-file       /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.key \\\n        --fullchain-file /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.crt\n# 新建 /etc/nginx/conf.d/ss.conf\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl http2;\n    server_name  ss.example.com;\n    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.key;\n    location /ws {                          # 路径可自定义\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_pass http://[IP_ADDRESS]:10086;

The goal was to identify an environmentally sound and cost-effective fertilization protocol, providing a theoretical basis for optimizing culture conditions and macrophyte management, and thereby safeguarding product safety."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Therefore, accurately defining the nutritional balance threshold among sediment fertilizer, aquatic plants, and water quality is a key step to increase survival rate, size uniformity, and yield per mu of Chinese mitten crab. However, systematic quantitative studies on the coupled mechanisms linking sediment fertilizer type and nutrient load to submerged macrophyte colonization, water-quality dynamics, and crab performance are still lacking.\n\nThrough indoor simulation experiments, this study compared the effects of different sediment fertilizers on the physiological and biochemical indices of submerged macrophytes (Elodea nuttallii and Hydrilla verticillata), sediment properties, and water quality in crab culture. The aim is to screen environmentally friendly and cost-effective fertilizer regimes, provide a theoretical basis for optimizing culture environments and improving macrophyte planting and fertilization management, and thereby offer important practical value for ensuring aquatic product quality and safety."}, {"role": "user", "content": "试验第0天布置完毕，每3天补水至25cm水位，每7天采样测水质，35天内共采5次，末次采样保存水草和底泥。"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "Web Search API.

Imagine you're giving instructions to a very obedient but extremely literal-minded robot friend.\n\nIf you say: \"Please bring me a glass of water,\" the robot might:\n1. Stand still (because you didn't say to walk)\n2. Or bring you the glass without water (because you didn't mention filling it)\n3. Or bring you an empty glass from the bathroom instead of the kitchen\n\nComputers are exactly like this robot - they follow instructions PRECISELY. A **program** is simply a list of these extremely specific instructions written in a language the computer understands.\n\n### What is Rust?\n\n**Rust** is one of these languages we use to write instructions for computers. Think of it like learning French or Spanish, but instead of talking to people, you're talking to computers.\n\nRust is special because:\n- It helps prevent many common mistakes\n- It runs very fast\n- It's used to build important software like web browsers, operating systems, and game engines\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Setting Up Your Computer\n\nBefore we start programming, we need to prepare your computer. This is like setting up a kitchen before you can cook.\n\n### Step 1: Installing Rust\n\n**Windows:**\n1. Open your web browser\n2. Go to: https://rustup.rs/\n3. Click the big button that says \"rustup-init.exe\"\n4. When it downloads, double-click to run it\n5. Press **1** when it asks for installation options\n6. Wait for it to finish (this might take 5-10 minutes)\n\n**Mac:**\n1. Open \"Terminal\" (you can find it by pressing Cmd+Space and typing \"terminal\")\n2. Copy and paste this command:\n   ```bash\n   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n   ```\n3. Press Enter and follow the instructions\n\n**Linux:**\n1. Open your terminal\n2. Use the same command as Mac:\n   ```bash\n   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Testing Your Installation\n\nAfter installation, close your terminal/command prompt and reopen it. Then type:\n\n```bash\nrustc --version\n```\n\nYou should see something like:\n```\nrustc 1.75.0 (82e1608df 2023-12-21)\n```\n\nDon't worry if the numbers are different - this just means it worked!\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Your First Program Explained\n\nLet's write the simplest possible program. This tradition is called \"Hello, World!\" - it's like learning to say \"Hello\" in a new language.\n\n### Creating Your Program\n\n1. Create a new folder on your desktop called \"rust-learning\"\n2. Open your terminal/command prompt\n3. Navigate to this folder:\n   - Windows: `cd Desktop\\rust-learning`\n   - Mac/Linux: `cd Desktop/rust-learning`\n4. Create a new project:\n   ```bash\n   cargo new hello_world\n   ```\n5. Go into the new folder:\n   ```bash\n   cd hello_world\n   ```\n\n### Understanding Your First Code\n\nOpen the file `hello_world/src/main.rs` in any text editor (like Notepad). You'll see:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n```\n\nLet's understand EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER:\n\n#### Line 1: `fn main() {`\n\n- **`fn`**: This is short for \"function\". Think of a function like a recipe - it's a set of instructions with a name.\n- **`main`**: This is the name of our function. The computer always starts with the `main` function - it's like the first page of instructions.\n- **`()`**: These parentheses are where we would put ingredients (called \"parameters\") if our recipe needed any. Empty means no ingredients needed.\n- **`{`**: This curly bracket means \"start of instructions\". Everything between `{` and `}` belongs to this function.\n\n#### Line 2: `    println!(\"Hello, world!\");`\n\n- **`println!`**: This is a command that means \"print line\". The `!` is special - it tells us this is a \"macro\" (a special kind of command).\n- **`(`**: Opening parenthesis for the command\n- **`\"Hello, world!\"`**: This is called a \"string\" - think of it as text wrapped in quotes\n- **`)`**: Closing parenthesis for the command\n- **`;`**: This semicolon means \"end of this instruction\". It's like a period at the end of a sentence.\n\n#### Line 3: `}`\n\n- **`}`**: This closes our function - it means \"end of instructions for main\"\n\n### Running Your Program\n\nIn your terminal, type:\n```bash\ncargo run\n```\n\nYou should see:\n```\n   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s\n     Running `target/debug/hello_world`\nHello, world!\n```\n\nCongratulations! You just wrote and ran your first computer program!\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Understanding Every Detail\n\n### What is Cargo?\n\nCargo is like a helpful assistant for Rust programming. It:\n- Builds (compiles) your programs\n- Downloads helpful tools (called \"crates\")\n- Manages your project files\n\n### What is \"Compiling\"?\n\nComputers don't understand Rust directly. Compiling is like translation - it converts your Rust code into instructions the computer can understand.\n\nThink of it like this:\n- You write in English (Rust code)\n- The compiler translates to Machine Language (0s and 1s)\n- The computer runs the translated version\n\n### Understanding Files and Folders\n\nYour `hello_world` folder looks like this:\n\n```\nhello_world/\n├── Cargo.toml          # Project configuration (like a recipe book cover)\n├── src/\n│   └── main.rs         # Your actual code (the recipe)\n└── target/             # Where compiled programs go\n```\n\n**Cargo.toml** contains information about your project:\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"hello_world\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\n```\n\nEach part means:\n- **`[package]`**: This section describes your project\n- **`name`**: What you call your project\n- **`version`**: What version this is (starts at 0.1.0)\n- **`edition`**: Which version of Rust rules to use\n- **`[dependencies]`**: Where you list any helper tools you want to use\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Making Changes\n\nLet's modify your program to understand it better.\n\n### Experiment 1: Changing the Message\n\nChange `main.rs` to:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, my name is [Your Name]!\");\n    println!(\"I'm learning Rust programming!\");\n}\n```\n\nRun it with `cargo run` again.\n\n### Experiment 2: Multiple Lines\n\nAdd more lines:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n    println!(\"This is my second line\");\n    println!(\"Rust is fun!\");\n}\n```\n\n### Understanding the Output\n\nNotice that each `println!` creates a new line. This is why it's called \"print LINE\" - it automatically adds a line break after each message.\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Common Questions and Troubleshooting\n\n### \"I got an error!\"\n\nDon't worry - errors are normal! Let's decode common ones:\n\n**Error: \"expected one of ., ;\"**\n- This means you forgot a semicolon `;` at the end of a line\n\n**Error: \"unresolved import\"**\n- This means you tried to use something that doesn't exist\n\n**Error: \"no such file or directory\"**\n- Make sure you're in the right folder when running `cargo run`\n\n### \"Nothing happens when I run cargo run\"\n- Make sure you saved your file after making changes\n- Check that you're in the correct folder (the one with Cargo.toml)\n\n### \"I don't understand something\"\n- That's completely normal! Programming takes time to learn\n- Try reading the explanation out loud\n- Take breaks and come back to it\n\n---\n\n## Part 7: Practice Exercises\n\nTry these to reinforce your learning:\n\n### Exercise 1: Personal Introduction\nCreate a program that prints:\n```\nHello! My name is [your name].\nI'm learning Rust programming.\nToday is [day of week].\n```\n\n### Exercise 2: ASCII Art\nCreate a program that prints a simple picture:\n```\n    /\\_/\\\n   ( o.o )\n    > ^ <\n```\n\n### Exercise 3: Multiple Messages\nCreate a program that prints:\n```\nStarting program...\nLoading...\nWelcome to Rust!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 8: What's Next?\n\nIn the next lesson, we will learn about:\n- **Variables**: How to store and use information\n- **Numbers**: Doing math with the computer\n- **User Input**: Making programs that respond to what users type\n- **Making Decisions**: Programs that can think (if statements)\n\n---\n\n## Summary Checklist\n\nBy now you should understand:\n- [ ] What a computer program is\n- [ ] What the Rust programming language is\n- [ ] How to install Rust on your computer\n- [ ] How to create a new project with `cargo new`\n- [ ] Every character in your first \"Hello, world!\" program\n- [ ] How to run your program with `cargo run`\n- [ ] What Cargo.toml is for\n- [ ] How to make simple changes to your program\n\nRemember: Programming is like learning a new language. It feels strange at first, but with practice, it becomes natural.

Like coin flips, each draw is independent and random, unaffected by any past results, so no predictable pattern can emerge.\n\n### How AI works  \nAI learns from large data sets and identifies patterns and correlations.

Head-teacher Liu Jin, as usual, came to inspect and found Wang’s seat empty. “According to common sense this child should have arrived long ago. I called the parents, but both phones were off—no one answered.” Liu Jin instinctively felt something was wrong, made a snap decision to visit the student’s home, and, after handing over his duties to other teachers, immediately drove there.  \n\nTeacher Liu reached the student’s home,  \nKnocked for several minutes,  \nNo response.  \n“The more I thought, the more wrong it felt.  \nThe Wang family is usually warm to teachers;  \nhow could no one open the door?  \nWas my knocking too quiet?”  \nSo Liu Jin “bang-bang-bang” pounded hard,  \nShouting the student’s name.  \nAfter two more minutes the door finally opened;  \nit was the child’s father.  \nIt turned out that at 5:40 that morning  \nthe mother had got up to cook breakfast,  \nthen lay down again “for just ten more minutes…”  \n\nGuomiao Town Central Primary School Chinese teacher  \nOn the afternoon of March 22,  \nWhile checking text recitation,  \nHe found five or six children who simply couldn’t memorize it.  \nTo encourage them,  \nTeacher Ding promised:  \n“If the whole class can recite before the end of the third period,  \nI’ll perform a stunt for you.”  \nHearing the promise,  \nThe pupils worked hard.  \nWhen the bell rang, every student could recite.  \nTeacher Ding warmed up,  \nSuddenly did a full split,  \nThe class was dumbstruck,  \nApplauding wildly;  \nSome kids jumped from their seats  \nGiving the teacher a thumbs-up.  \n“As a teacher,  \nWhat you promise students  \nYou must deliver.  \nIt encourages learning  \nAnd sets an example through action.”  \n\nIn daily life Teacher Ding is a “sports ace,”  \nGood at basketball, table-tennis, wushu,  \nAnd actively leads students in exercise after class.  \nFor 23 years he has stayed on the front line of rural education,  \nCarefully observing each pupil’s behavior  \nAnd finding ways to encourage them.  \nNow his former students fill the land;  \nEvery holiday, graduates visit his home,  \nWhich has become a fixed gathering place.  \n\n“Those who cultivate people must first cultivate hearts;  \nThose who cultivate hearts must cultivate themselves.”  \nTeacher Ding’s care  \nWill surely light the children’s way forward.  \n\nHe succeeded both in teaching and in defending the country!  \nAt a middle school in Yuancheng, Heyuan, Guangdong,  \nArt teacher Ye Weihao enlisted in the army.  \nThe moving scene of his video-call farewell to his students  \nWent viral online.\n\n[Search keyword]: Examples of warm-hearted, enthusiastic teachers\n\n[ID]: [^3^]  \nTitle: Be a Good Teacher for Life, Let Every Student Shine!  \nWebsite: Suzhou Government  \nDate: 2024-09-20  \nExcerpt 1:  \nGe Juan believes that only by building deep affection with students, caring for them, loving them and helping them with full enthusiasm can a teacher win their trust and form a good teacher-student relationship. Once the relationship is sound, students will “love the teacher and believe in his path.”  \n\nEvery semester Ge Juan’s first lesson is a game that lets students spend a relaxed, happy period. She also “plants seeds” on festivals: respect for teachers, respect for the old, finding joy in hardship, expressing love for family aloud, reading, and honoring labor…  \n\nGrade 9 is the hardest year, yet Ge Juan’s pupils look forward to it, because each month they celebrate collective birthdays; Ge Juan bakes chocolate cupcakes—bitterness followed by sweetness, just like Grade 9 life. At graduation she gives each student a tailor-made gift: a book with a dedication on the fly-leaf and a snapshot from the three years—crossing the sports-day finish line first, sitting oddly due to back injury yet persisting in the exam, holding a chalk carving… Nothing costly, but it reaches their hearts.  \n\nSowing seeds of love all the way, Ge Juan harvests students’ love and trust. They willingly confide in her. Faced with a boy’s wish to quit school, Tang Qiaohua did not simply reject it; she told him, “Life offers many choices, all worthy of respect—only escape is not.” For several days she left home early to pick him up, gave him extra coaching, and with help from other teachers and his parents he soon improved markedly in a unit test, his confidence soaring.  \n\nOnce held back a year for surgery, the boy always remembered Tang’s words. After recovery he returned, and finally entered his dream school.  \n\n“Being a scholar is easy; being a teacher is hard.” For over thirty years Tang Qiaohua has shaped students’ souls with love, molded their character with personality, and guided their progress with patience. Her children remember: it was Teacher Tang who handed them class duties and activities step by step to build confidence; who recommended them for the school traffic-squad to learn rules; who talked patiently with parents to change bad habits… These “small things” in her eyes will surely influence their whole lives.\n\n[Search keyword]: Examples of open-minded, enthusiastic teachers\n\n[ID]: [^4^]  \nTitle: A Model Around Us: The Beloved Teacher Liu Fang  \nWebsite: Xinhua  \nDate: 2015-11-18  \nExcerpt 1:  \nA teacher with severe eye disease, almost blind, yet spreads love to every child and devotes her energy to the education she loves. Her optimistic, upward spirit moves her students and everyone around her. She is Liu Fang, nominated for Guizhou Province’s 4th “Courtesy and Virtue” moral model award.  \n\nJanuary 7 morning, reporters followed a press group to Baiyun No. 3 Middle School and met this beloved teacher.  \n\n**Rooted in the countryside, whole-heartedly devoted to the three-foot platform**  \n\nPhoto: some of Liu Fang’s certificates and her original novel “Green Pomegranate”  \n\nFor 21 years Liu Fang has rooted herself in rural education, serving and dedicating herself to it. In 1997 she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa; she has gradually moved from light into darkness, yet the severe disease has not affected her inner strength, optimism and passion for life and work. In class she communicates with her heart; relying on faint light and years of experience, she asks, “Is my writing crooked?” and, guided by students, feels the blackboard to write. Thus, for ten years, while conquering her eye disease, she has composed a plain yet optimistic movement of a mountain village woman teacher.  \n\nIn nearly 21 years of teaching she has been a head-teacher for 14, facing her illness with optimistic openness and her class management with fortitude, becoming a banner of the school’s spiritual civilization.\n\n[Search keyword]: Examples of teachers enthusiastically helping students\n\n[ID]: [^5^]  \nTitle: “Teacher Wang, Meeting You Was Our Luck!”  \nWebsite: Xihua University  \nDate: 2024-03-19  \nExcerpt 1:  \n“Meeting Sister Yan in university was our luck,” says 2017 Brewing Engineering graduate Qiao Wei’e. “In my heart Sister Yan is like an elder sister, taking special care of us both in life and study.

Cartier’s records note that she supplied over a thousand brilliant-cut diamonds and more than 400 rose-cut diamonds, while Cartier supplied further rose-cut diamonds and the paste stones which make up the scrolls at the end of each side.<br>This tiara of graduated flaming hearts and C scrolls was inspired by a vision of France before the Revolution. Louis Cartier encouraged his designers to sketch 18th-century ironwork and architectural ornament in Paris and Versailles, and to study engraved jewellery designs.<br>Consuelo, Duchess of Manchester (1858-1909), was the daughter of Antonio Yznaga del Valle, of Ravenswood, Louisiana, New York and Cuba. Consuelo was taken by her mother to Paris where her American friends included Jennie Jerome, later to be the mother of Winston Churchill and Alva Smith, later to be Alva Vanderbilt. Consuelo married George Victor Drogo Montagu, Viscount Mandeville, the future 8th Duke of Manchester, in 1876. The Duke of Portland recorded that she ‘took Society completely by storm by her beauty, wit and vivacity and it was soon at her very pretty feet’. She became a friend of Queen Alexandra to whom she bequeathed a bracelet on her death in 1909.

Here’s how it works.\n\nFirst, make sure to install the **aiosmtplib**.\n\nNow, here’s the script:\n\n**Quick breakdown**:\n\n-  **Asynchronous function definition**: The script now defines asynchronous functions using `async def`.\n\n-  **Async functionality**: Utilizing ‘asyncio and ‘aiosmtplib’, the script establishes an SMTP connection asynchronously, logs in, and sends the email. This approach allows for non-blocking email sending, which is particularly useful in applications that require maintaining responsiveness while performing network operations.\n\n-  **Running the script**: The `main` async function sets up the email details and calls send\\_email\\_async to send the email. It demonstrates how to run asynchronous tasks in Python effectively, with `asyncio.run(main())` bootstrapping the asynchronous execution.\n\n[搜索关键词]:email_processor.py implementation\n\n[编号]:[^3^]\n[标题]:Automating Emails with Python: A Comprehensive Guide\n[网站名称]:keentolearn.medium.com\n[日期]: 2023-02-14\n片段 1：\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nPhoto by Team Nocoloco on Unsplash\n\nEmail is a critical means of communication in today’s world, but it can be time-consuming and tedious to send out emails manually. Fortunately, Python provides a simple and efficient way to automate email sending and receiving tasks. In this article, we will explore how to use Python to automate emails, starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced techniques.\n\n## Getting started with Python’s built-in `smtplib` library\n\nThe simplest way to automate email sending in Python is by using the built-in `smtplib` library. The `smtplib` library is a powerful tool that allows you to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). To use the `smtplib` library, you must first set up an email account that can be used to send emails programmatically.\n\n## Sending email with Python\n\nOnce you have set up your email account, you can use Python to send emails. To send an email, you will need to import the `smtplib` library, create an instance of the `SMTP` class, log in to your email account, and send the email.\n\nHere’s an example code snippet that sends a simple email using Python:\n\n```\nimport smtplibsmtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'\nsmtp_port = 587\nsmtp_username = '[EMAIL]'\nsmtp_password = 'yourpassword'from_email = '[EMAIL]'\nto_email = '[EMAIL]'\nsubject = 'Hello, world!'\nbody = 'This is a test email.'message = f'Subject: {subject}\\n\\n{body}'with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as smtp:\n    smtp.starttls()\n    smtp.login(smtp_username, smtp_password)\n    smtp.sendmail(from_email, to_email, message)\n```\n\n-  This code sends an email from `[EMAIL]` to `[EMAIL]` with the subject \"Hello, world!\" and the body \"This is a test email.\"\n\n-  The `starttls()` method enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, which ensures that the email is transmitted securely.\n\n-  The `login()` method logs in to your email account using your username and password.\n\n-  Finally, the `sendmail()` method sends the email to the recipient.\n\n[搜索关键词]:email automation challenge requirements\n\n[编号]:[^4^]\n[标题]:Email marketing automation challenges and how businesses overcome them\n[网站名称]:okoone.com\n[日期]: 2024-02-01\n片段 1：\n## Establishing a culture of continuous testing and learning\n\nCMOs should experiment with different elements of email campaigns to determine what works best. Marketers can test subject lines, email designs, or send times, analyze the results, and use the insights gained to improve future emails for better performance.\n\nThe challenge here lies in executing rigorous testing protocols to validate the effectiveness of segmentation strategies. This means setting up A/B tests to determine the success of different email subject lines for different segments, for instance. The CMO must ensure that these tests yield meaningful data to inform future campaigns without exceeding budget constraints and while maintaining the brand’s integrity in a competitive environment that’s constantly in flux.\n\nFinally, establishing a culture of continuous testing and optimization is crucial. By implementing A/B testing protocols, marketers can assess the impact of different email subject lines on open rates and conversions. These tests should be designed to produce statistically significant results that can inform future campaigns. For example, if a test reveals that personalized subject lines significantly outperform generic ones, this insight can be used to tailor future emails. Training teams to understand and act on these insights keeps testing as a core part of the marketing strategy and not a rigid box-ticking exercise.\n\n[搜索关键词]:email_processor.py implementation\n\n[编号]:[^5^]\n[标题]:How to send emails in Python (with script examples) - MailerSend\n[网站名称]:mailersend.com\n[日期]: 2024-07-25\n片段 1：\n## How to send emails with Python\n\n### Sending emails in Python with an email API\n\nUsing a third-party email API is a great option if you want to create more advanced workflows with additional email-sending features and tracking options.

For example, using integrated marketing tools for precise doctor targeting, significantly improving marketing conversion. To enhance management, companies need to leverage full-chain data capabilities to activate data value, build data analysis systems to fully reflect business status, and shift from experience-driven to data-driven management.  \n\nFigure 7: Business value of the integrated digital marketing platform  \n\nCurrently, the company has used the platform to significantly improve sales operation efficiency and outreach effectiveness. In the future, Taimed Medical Technology will continue to enhance the platform with CMS, CDP, MA, and other modules to help more companies achieve digital marketing transformation and sales growth.  \n\n**03 Compliant Marketing**\n\nThe implementation of the \"two-invoice system\" and \"business tax to VAT\" reform has shifted pharma companies from a \"bottom-price agency\" model to a \"marketing service outsourcing\" model. Previously distributed rebates are now borne by pharma companies, leading to risks such as fake VAT invoices to cover commercial bribery.  \n\nTo ensure compliance, companies require CSOs to provide complete evidence chains for promotional services. With the launch of \"Golden Tax Phase IV,\" regulation has shifted from \"invoice-based\" to \"data-based,\" requiring full traceability of marketing activities.  \n\nKey pain points include: lack of穿透式 management based on real business, non-standardized marketing behaviors, and low willingness among service providers to cooperate.  \n\nThe mainstream solution is to build a compliant marketing management system covering both expenses and behaviors.  \n\n**Case Study 2: Sihuan Pharmaceutical**  \n\nBeyi Technology helped Sihuan build standardized compliance guidelines, dividing marketing into 31 service items such as doctor visits, academic meetings, and case collection, each with defined compliance and cost standards.  \n\nFive systems were deployed:  \n- **Imms**: Budget and settlement management  \n- **Ctrans**: Service procurement system  \n- **药合作**: Business management for service providers  \n- **药友料**: Tools for medical reps  \n- **Mbas**: Data analytics and intelligent recommendations for management  \n\nResults:  \n- Standardized compliance marketing  \n- Full-process online traceability  \n- Human resource cost reduced from 200+ to 50+ people  \n- Cost dropped from ¥70M to ¥20M  \n- Settlement efficiency improved 6x  \n- Sales workload reduced by 40%  \n- Contract efficiency up 75%  \n- Academic knowledge base usage up 30%, driving 7% sales growth  \n\n**04 Digital Production Workshop**  \n\nTibet Pharmaceutical built a management cockpit with dashboards for sales, market, business, promotion, and terminal analysis, enabling visualized key metrics for revenue and profit.  \n\nUsing Smartbi’s BI and big data tools, Tibet Pharmaceutical built an indicator system with 411 metrics across 5 layers (strategy, operations, management, etc.), 25 dashboards, and 5 cockpits.  \n\nResults:  \n- Unified data integration  \n- Automated data processing  \n- Real-time decision-making  \n- Manual reporting replaced by visual dashboards  \n\n**07 Conclusion**\n\n[^3^]  \nTitle: *How Pharma Companies Can Achieve Low-Cost Custom Development of GMP-Compliant Applications* – Sina Finance  \nURL: https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-07-22/doc-infhiuqv4647182.shtml?froms=ggmp  \nSource: Sina Finance  \nDate: 2025-07-22  \nExcerpt 1:  \nConclusion  \n\nAmid regulatory storms and digital transformation, Mofangwangbiao redefines GMP compliance logic with disruptive tech architecture, offering a new solution for pharma companies to improve efficiency under GMP conditions. It reduces development and operational costs while solving efficiency and data management issues.  \n\nThis Mofangwangbiao-driven revolution marks a shift from \"passive compliance\" to \"proactive data-driven\" transformation.  \n\n**Cases**  \n\n**Kelun Pharmaceutical**  \n\nKelun introduced Mofangwangbiao to solve data management challenges. The system covers production, quality, and R&D with electronic records and workflows. It enables automatic data collection, reduces manual input errors, monitors production in real time, and ensures full traceability for regulatory compliance.  \n\n**Minsheng Pharmaceutical**  \n\nFounded in 1926, Minsheng used Mofangwangbiao to build a GMP-compliant, flexible QMS system.

Today, I invite you to open a book—any book—and step through a door that never locks yet always leads somewhere new. Reading is not a hobby; it is a second life, cheaper than a plane ticket and wider than the sky.\n\nWhen I was eight, I hid under a quilt with a flashlight and a dog-eared copy of “Journey to the West.” Outside, my village had no streetlights and only one road out; inside those pages, I traveled on a flying cloud, fought demons, and discovered that courage can be borrowed from fictional monks and returned with interest. That night I learned the first secret of reading: it turns the small room of your childhood into a palace with endless corridors.\n\nYears later, science confirmed what every reader already feels in their bones. MRI scans show that when we read about the scent of rain on dry earth, the olfactory cortex lights up; when we read about a character stubbing a toe, the motor cortex winces. The brain, generous magician, rehearses every experience we give it. In other words, books let us practice being human without bruising actual skin.\n\nYet the statistics bruise us anyway. Last year, the average Chinese adult finished 4.76 books; on TikTok, the same person scrolled 1,200 hours. We are exchanging forests of nuance for feeds of noise. The cost is subtle but lethal: a vocabulary shrinks, a sympathy atrophies, a democracy grows more allergic to complexity. When we stop reading long-form, we stop reading long faces; we forget that people, unlike posts, cannot be swiped away.\n\nSo how do we reclaim the kingdom of print in the empire of swipe? Let me offer three practical rungs on the ladder back to literacy.\n\nFirst, tether reading to an existing habit. Place a book on your pillow each morning; you cannot sleep without moving it, and once it is in your hand, ten pages will do the rest. Second, read with a pencil. Margins are private battlefields where you argue with the author, and victory is measured in asterisks and exclamation points. Third, protect a daily “sacred quarter-hour.” Set a timer, silence the phone, and announce to your family: “I am unavailable unless the house is on fire—if it is, drag the bookshelf out first.”\n\nSome will say, “But I have no time.” I answer: we have 1,440 minutes a day; give 15 to books and you still own 96 percent of your life. Others protest, “But I read on my phone.” I reply: screens are windows; books are doors. Windows are for watching; doors are for crossing. Choose the architecture that actually moves you into another room.\n\nImagine if every citizen in this hall read just one extra book a month. That is 3.6 million new journeys taken, 3.6 million private revolutions started. One of them might design a greener battery; another might refuse a bribe; a third might simply forgive her father. Societies are not transformed by slogans but by stories that lodge too deep to uproot.\n\nIn the end, reading is not about impressing others with the height of your bookshelf; it is about defending the last private space that no algorithm can fully invade. It is the quiet declaration: “I still belong to myself.” So tonight, when the lights go off and the Wi-Fi blinks like a tired eye, reach for a book. Let the spine crack like a fireplace, let the letters warm your palms, and remember—every page is a passport, every reader a refugee who chooses to travel, chooses to stay, chooses finally to come home enlarged.\n\nClose the book, and you close a door; but the room you re-enter—your own life—will never be quite the same size again.\n\nThank you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Change it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course!

The title of my speech today is “The Joy of Reading.”\n\nReading is a marvelous journey across time and space. When I open a book, I seem to hear the echoes of history and feel the breath of the ancients. Reading *Records of the Grand Historian*, I see Sima Qian writing furiously in prison, recording a thousand years of events with his words. Reading *Dream of the Red Chamber*, I walk into the Grand View Garden and watch Baoyu and Daiyu perform joys and sorrows amid splendor. Reading *Journey to the West*, I join the Tang Monk and his disciples on the road to obtain the scriptures, subduing demons along the way, feeling persistence and courage. These stories let me, in just a few hours, experience the joys and sorrows of other people’s entire lives, gaining growth and wisdom.\n\nReading is also a dialogue with the great. When I read *Steve Jobs*, I saw how a dropout youth ignited the spark of innovation in a garage and finally changed the world. His story tells me: stay curious, dare to be different, and you can live your own brilliance. Reading *Madame Curie*, I saw a woman in a male-dominated scientific world win two Nobel Prizes through tenacity and wisdom. Her story made me understand: gender is not a limit, prejudice is not a shackle; if you hold on to your dream, you can break out of the cocoon and become a butterfly.\n\nReading is, even more, a baptism of the soul. When I feel lost, *The Little Prince* tells me: “What is essential is invisible to the eye”; one must feel with the heart. When I feel discouraged, *Kafka on the Shore* tells me: “Once you’ve weathered the storm, you are no longer the same person”; persevere and grow. When I become arrogant, *The Analects* tells me: “When three walk together, there must be a teacher among them”; stay humble and keep learning.\n\nDear classmates, the joy of reading lies not only in acquiring knowledge but in making us better people. It lets us find a peaceful haven in a noisy world, discover direction in our bewildered youth, and uncover extraordinary meaning in ordinary life.\n\nLet us treasure every chance to open a book, and make reading a habit, a way of life. For the joy of reading is something no game, no short video can replace. It is like a lamp that lights our path, a key that opens the door to our soul, a pair of wings that carries us toward a broader sky.\n\nMy speech ends here.

Today, I want to share with you the simple yet profound joy of reading.\n\nReading is a journey that begins the moment you open a book. It takes you to places you’ve never been and introduces you to people you’ve never met. Whether it’s exploring distant galaxies in a science fiction novel or walking through ancient cities in a history book, reading expands your world without ever leaving your chair.\n\nBut the joy of reading goes beyond adventure. It’s in the quiet moments—when you find a sentence that speaks directly to your heart, when you solve a mystery alongside a clever detective, or when you learn something new that makes you see the world differently. Reading teaches empathy by letting you live through another person’s experiences, and it builds knowledge one page at a time.\n\nIn our busy lives, reading offers a peaceful escape. It doesn’t require batteries or Wi-Fi—just a book and your imagination. So let’s make time to read, not because we have to, but because we want to. Let’s rediscover the joy that waits patiently on every page.\n\nThank you.", "tool_calls": null}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": null}, "status": "success", "finish_reason": "stop", "tool_calls_valid": null, "last_run_at": "2026-01-28T11:50:10.336729", "duration_ms": 9703, "hash": "13405b70399202d761d8a61006e49f78"}

One morning, Grandma carried a bamboo basket and stood under the tree, gently shaking the branches. Golden flowers fell like rain, pattering into the basket. I leaned against the doorframe, urging her, “Hurry up, I have to go to school.” Grandma didn’t answer. She picked up the flowers one by one, carefully removing the stems and withered petals, her fingers moving as slowly as the clouds in the sky.\n\nAfter school, the kitchen was filled with a sweet scent. Grandma had spread the osmanthus on a bamboo sieve and placed it by the window to dry. The setting sun coated her silver hair with a layer of gold. I threw my backpack down and muttered, “Isn’t it just making osmanthus wine? Why take so many days?” Grandma smiled and handed me a cup of warm tea. “Good things need to wait.”\n\nI didn’t believe her. In my world, everything had to be fast—fast food, fast answers, fast grades. I even ate osmanthus candy in two bites, unable to taste anything.\n\nSeven days later, Grandma finally took out the clay jar. The dried osmanthus was mixed with rock sugar and white wine, layered gently, sealed, and hidden in the cool shade under the bed. Every week, she would uncover it, sniff it, and add a spoonful of honey. I watched her serious expression and suddenly felt that the jar seemed to hold not just flowers, but time itself.\n\nWhen the first snow fell, Grandma scooped out a small cup for me. The pale golden liquid glowed in the porcelain cup. I took a sip, and the fragrance bloomed on my tongue—layers of flowers, sunlight, and breeze. That moment, I seemed to hear the osmanthus blossoms falling in the autumn wind, saw Grandma’s gentle fingertips, and felt the days and nights quietly settling in the jar.\n\nI finally understood that “slow” is not procrastination, but a kind of respect—respect for ingredients, for time, for the people you love. That cup of osmanthus wine was Grandma’s way of teaching me: only when you slow down can beauty reveal its true shape.\n\nNow, every autumn, I still dry osmanthus under the sun. The golden flowers shine like fragments of time.
