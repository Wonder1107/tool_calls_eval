This transcript shows the coordinated, embodied way in which this team interacted with the VR objects and the way they communicated using speech and actions with their virtual hands on virtual objects. These teachers also noted some limitations of VR technology, with Vickey citing issues related to behavior management and content coverage: “It is obviously not applicable to everything we learn, and there is always the possibility that students will not take the task seriously.” Kelly also brought up technical issues, “Some limitations include setting up the VR environment and overcoming technical issues. There would have to be a tech person in each class to trouble shoot issues such as the ones we encountered in the session.”\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n_Riley and Kelly Exploring Task 4 in Table 1_\n\nOverall, our thematic analysis revealed key affordances for these novice high school teachers included it being collaborative, with emphasis on tasks that require collaboration and its affordances for collaboration during virtual learning. Some key limitations included VR being technically difficult to use, not applicable to all areas, and causing classroom management issues.\n\n[搜索关键词]:3D female doctor digital human front view classroom teaching with clicker\n\n[编号]:[^6^]\n[标题]:Holograms for seamless integration of remote students in ...\n[网站名称]:Springer\n[日期]: \n片段 1：\n## 6 Discussion\n\nFirstly, we must state that overall, the three feedback provided by the users and their qualitative evaluation was positive, as highlighted by the survey. The users’ comments also praised the emoji to represent the emotion of the users and the holograms representing them. However, there were some comments regarding the limitations of the current implementation. Some users were concerned about the battery autonomy duration, the field of view and the cost of the device, which are specific issues of the HoloLens 2 headset we used. Flickering and delay in the image transmission were also reported. Additionally, one user stated some discomfort about the fact a pattern is needed wherever the holograms should be displayed. All these matters will be taken into account in future work.\n\nThe limitations of HoloLens 2, such as its cost and battery life, have implications for both instructors and students in an MR learning environment.\n\nFirstly, the cost of the device can be a barrier for instructors and educational institutions. The higher price of HoloLens 2 may make it difficult for some instructors to adopt this technology for teaching purposes. However, the cost of the device is expected to fall over time, making it more affordable for universities. Once the cost becomes more reasonable, instructors can leverage the MR environment to enhance their teaching methods and provide students with immersive and interactive experiences.\n\nSecondly, the limited battery life of HoloLens 2 poses challenges for instructors who intend to use the device for extended periods. The two to three hours of active use may not be sufficient to cover a longer class session or multiple consecutive classes. However, the device’s compatibility with external batteries provides a solution to this drawback. By utilizing external batteries, instructors can ensure continuous functionality of the device while charging, allowing them to use HoloLens 2 throughout the required class time without interruption.\n\n", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "id": "functions.urls_fetch_tool:2", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "arguments": "{\"urls\": [\"https://www.shutterstock.com/search/3d-teacher-women\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "", "tool_call_id": "functions.urls_fetch_tool:2"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

Decimals within a specified range (non-integer)\nTo create, say, a 2-decimal number between 5 and 10:\n```excel\n=ROUND(RAND() * (10 - 5) + 5, 2)\n```\n- Logic: `RAND() * (upper - lower) + lower`  \n- Use `ROUND` to set decimal places.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 4. Non-repeating random integers (advanced)\nTo pull, for example, 10 unique integers from 1 to 100:\n\n1. In column A enter `=RAND()` as a helper.  \n2. In column B use `=RANK(A1, A:A)` to get ranks.  \n3. The first 10 ranks are your unique random numbers.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Notes:\n- All these functions are **volatile**; they refresh on every sheet change.  \n- To **lock** the generated numbers, copy the cells (`Ctrl + C`) → paste as **Values** (`Ctrl + V` → choose “Values”).\n\n---\n\nWant me to build you a template?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I want to generate random decimals"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Below are the 3 most common “generate random decimal” formulas—copy them straight into Excel.

A段（0'19''–1'12''）：王铮亮流行男声主唱，旋律以级进为主，节奏舒缓如述；伴奏仅用弦乐pad与点状竖琴，留出大片“水面”。  \n3. B段（1'13''–2'06''）：王珮瑜京剧老生腔接入，板鼓、小锣切入，节拍由4/4转为有板无眼的散板，音区提高四度，形成“水墨中突然焦墨一笔”的戏剧张力。  \n4. 间奏（2'07''–2'34''）：琵琶轮指与电子低频对位，古今音色碰撞，暗示“时空对话”。  \n5. A'段（2'35''–3'28''）：二人交替——流行长音托住戏曲甩腔，和声上采用add4与sus2，使“水波”与“人声”叠映，情绪升至顶点。  \n6. 尾声（3'29''–4'28''）：所有打击乐抽离，古筝回到最初的动机，箫以气声渐弱，象征钓翁收竿、水天合一。\n\n三、音高与调式  \n歌曲以D宫五声调式为基底，但在B段临时转至其下属调G宫，利用“变宫为角”的模糊游移，表现“仕”与“隐”的徘徊。尾声通过微分音的箫滑音，把宫音拉回D，完成“求仕—归隐—天人合一”的闭环。\n\n四、节奏与律动  \n主歌采用“伸缩拍”（rubato），鼓组以手拍水面采样替代传统军鼓，每四拍出现一次逆波，制造“浮力”。副歌进入稳定4/4，底鼓与板鼓重音错位，形成“水波推舟”的摇摆感。\n\n五、音色与配器  \n制作团队刻意让“古”与“今”保持5:5的声量平衡：  \n古——箫、古筝、琵琶、板鼓、小锣  \n今——合成器pad、电子低音、环境采样、流行鼓组  \n混音上将古乐器定位在左右30°以内，电子声相扩展至60°，中央留下人声通道，使“山水”环“人物”，符合中国画“留白”法则。\n\n六、演唱风格  \n王铮亮用半气声与胸声混合，保持“叙述”质感；王珮瑜则以“云遮月”的老生腔，在句尾使用擞音与裂音，模拟钓线提拉的顿挫。二人交替时，流行声部常做“倚音”下行，戏曲声部做“甩音”上行，一抑一扬，恰似文王俯身、太公抬竿的画面。\n\n七、歌词意象  \n“一竿风月”“两岸青山”“白云深处有龙吟”三句，分别以“竿”“岸”“云”为支点，构成竖向空间；“渭水东流”“星斗转移”则给出横向时间。词作者用“竖空间＋横时间”的十字结构，让听众在二维画面里感知三维时空。\n\n八、整体审美  \n作品以“静水”为形，以“隐贤”为神，以“访贤”为戏剧冲突，最终落到“天人合一”的东方宇宙观。音乐上通过调式游移、节奏松紧、古今音色三层对比，把“仕”与“隐”的辩证关系化为可听的“水纹”，让典故不再是书本上的铅字，而成为耳畔流动的山水。", "name": "search", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}, {"role": "system", "content": "- Evaluate whether the returned search results fully answer the user’s question; if information is insufficient, continue calling search or other tools.  \n- Only provide the final reply after all tool calls are complete.  \n- When writing the reply: if the question is time-sensitive, use only information from the search results that is explicitly dated and whose date matches; cite any quoted web content by adding [^corresponding number^] at the end of the sentence.", "name": "resource"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

They also stabilize water quality. The substrate anchors submerged plants, offering physical support and nutrients to the roots [8]. Growth is governed by light, temperature, water depth, dissolved oxygen, and bottom-fertilizer type. Among these, the type and properties of the bottom fertilizer are fundamental for macrophyte establishment; the sediment fixes the root system and supplies trace elements and nutrients, serving as the main nutrient source [9]. Submerged plants absorb nutrients from both the sediment via roots and the water column via stems and leaves [10–12]. Yet excessive sediment nutrients can inhibit growth and trigger eutrophication. Liu et al. [13] found that, under mesotrophic conditions, single-plant maximum biomass of Myriophyllum and Ceratophyllum exceeded that under eutrophic conditions by 39 % and 22 %, respectively. Wang et al. [14] showed that eutrophication impaired Hydrilla verticillata; when ammonium rose beyond a threshold, physiological stress and growth inhibition occurred. These studies reveal a clear nutrient-dependent response: high nutrients suppress growth, whereas low nutrients limit development. Sediment fertilizers continuously release N and P through oxidative decomposition, degrading overlying water and destabilizing the aquatic ecosystem [15].\n\nResolving these nutrient-sediment interactions is therefore critical for sustaining healthy crab culture systems.

Head-teacher Liu Jin, as usual, came to inspect and found Wang’s seat empty. “According to common sense this child should have arrived long ago. I called the parents, but both phones were off—no one answered.” Liu Jin instinctively felt something was wrong, made a snap decision to visit the student’s home, and, after handing over his duties to other teachers, immediately drove there.  \n\nTeacher Liu reached the student’s home,  \nKnocked for several minutes,  \nNo response.  \n“The more I thought, the more wrong it felt.  \nThe Wang family is usually warm to teachers;  \nhow could no one open the door?  \nWas my knocking too quiet?”  \nSo Liu Jin “bang-bang-bang” pounded hard,  \nShouting the student’s name.  \nAfter two more minutes the door finally opened;  \nit was the child’s father.  \nIt turned out that at 5:40 that morning  \nthe mother had got up to cook breakfast,  \nthen lay down again “for just ten more minutes…”  \n\nGuomiao Town Central Primary School Chinese teacher  \nOn the afternoon of March 22,  \nWhile checking text recitation,  \nHe found five or six children who simply couldn’t memorize it.  \nTo encourage them,  \nTeacher Ding promised:  \n“If the whole class can recite before the end of the third period,  \nI’ll perform a stunt for you.”  \nHearing the promise,  \nThe pupils worked hard.  \nWhen the bell rang, every student could recite.  \nTeacher Ding warmed up,  \nSuddenly did a full split,  \nThe class was dumbstruck,  \nApplauding wildly;  \nSome kids jumped from their seats  \nGiving the teacher a thumbs-up.  \n“As a teacher,  \nWhat you promise students  \nYou must deliver.  \nIt encourages learning  \nAnd sets an example through action.”  \n\nIn daily life Teacher Ding is a “sports ace,”  \nGood at basketball, table-tennis, wushu,  \nAnd actively leads students in exercise after class.  \nFor 23 years he has stayed on the front line of rural education,  \nCarefully observing each pupil’s behavior  \nAnd finding ways to encourage them.  \nNow his former students fill the land;  \nEvery holiday, graduates visit his home,  \nWhich has become a fixed gathering place.  \n\n“Those who cultivate people must first cultivate hearts;  \nThose who cultivate hearts must cultivate themselves.”  \nTeacher Ding’s care  \nWill surely light the children’s way forward.  \n\nHe succeeded both in teaching and in defending the country!  \nAt a middle school in Yuancheng, Heyuan, Guangdong,  \nArt teacher Ye Weihao enlisted in the army.  \nThe moving scene of his video-call farewell to his students  \nWent viral online.\n\n[Search keyword]: Examples of warm-hearted, enthusiastic teachers\n\n[ID]: [^3^]  \nTitle: Be a Good Teacher for Life, Let Every Student Shine!  \nWebsite: Suzhou Government  \nDate: 2024-09-20  \nExcerpt 1:  \nGe Juan believes that only by building deep affection with students, caring for them, loving them and helping them with full enthusiasm can a teacher win their trust and form a good teacher-student relationship. Once the relationship is sound, students will “love the teacher and believe in his path.”  \n\nEvery semester Ge Juan’s first lesson is a game that lets students spend a relaxed, happy period. She also “plants seeds” on festivals: respect for teachers, respect for the old, finding joy in hardship, expressing love for family aloud, reading, and honoring labor…  \n\nGrade 9 is the hardest year, yet Ge Juan’s pupils look forward to it, because each month they celebrate collective birthdays; Ge Juan bakes chocolate cupcakes—bitterness followed by sweetness, just like Grade 9 life. At graduation she gives each student a tailor-made gift: a book with a dedication on the fly-leaf and a snapshot from the three years—crossing the sports-day finish line first, sitting oddly due to back injury yet persisting in the exam, holding a chalk carving… Nothing costly, but it reaches their hearts.  \n\nSowing seeds of love all the way, Ge Juan harvests students’ love and trust. They willingly confide in her. Faced with a boy’s wish to quit school, Tang Qiaohua did not simply reject it; she told him, “Life offers many choices, all worthy of respect—only escape is not.” For several days she left home early to pick him up, gave him extra coaching, and with help from other teachers and his parents he soon improved markedly in a unit test, his confidence soaring.  \n\nOnce held back a year for surgery, the boy always remembered Tang’s words. After recovery he returned, and finally entered his dream school.  \n\n“Being a scholar is easy; being a teacher is hard.” For over thirty years Tang Qiaohua has shaped students’ souls with love, molded their character with personality, and guided their progress with patience. Her children remember: it was Teacher Tang who handed them class duties and activities step by step to build confidence; who recommended them for the school traffic-squad to learn rules; who talked patiently with parents to change bad habits… These “small things” in her eyes will surely influence their whole lives.\n\n[Search keyword]: Examples of open-minded, enthusiastic teachers\n\n[ID]: [^4^]  \nTitle: A Model Around Us: The Beloved Teacher Liu Fang  \nWebsite: Xinhua  \nDate: 2015-11-18  \nExcerpt 1:  \nA teacher with severe eye disease, almost blind, yet spreads love to every child and devotes her energy to the education she loves. Her optimistic, upward spirit moves her students and everyone around her. She is Liu Fang, nominated for Guizhou Province’s 4th “Courtesy and Virtue” moral model award.  \n\nJanuary 7 morning, reporters followed a press group to Baiyun No. 3 Middle School and met this beloved teacher.  \n\n**Rooted in the countryside, whole-heartedly devoted to the three-foot platform**  \n\nPhoto: some of Liu Fang’s certificates and her original novel “Green Pomegranate”  \n\nFor 21 years Liu Fang has rooted herself in rural education, serving and dedicating herself to it. In 1997 she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa; she has gradually moved from light into darkness, yet the severe disease has not affected her inner strength, optimism and passion for life and work. In class she communicates with her heart; relying on faint light and years of experience, she asks, “Is my writing crooked?” and, guided by students, feels the blackboard to write. Thus, for ten years, while conquering her eye disease, she has composed a plain yet optimistic movement of a mountain village woman teacher.  \n\nIn nearly 21 years of teaching she has been a head-teacher for 14, facing her illness with optimistic openness and her class management with fortitude, becoming a banner of the school’s spiritual civilization.\n\n[Search keyword]: Examples of teachers enthusiastically helping students\n\n[ID]: [^5^]  \nTitle: “Teacher Wang, Meeting You Was Our Luck!”  \nWebsite: Xihua University  \nDate: 2024-03-19  \nExcerpt 1:  \n“Meeting Sister Yan in university was our luck,” says 2017 Brewing Engineering graduate Qiao Wei’e. “In my heart Sister Yan is like an elder sister, taking special care of us both in life and study.

It also has an artisanal mining business, **Gemfair**, which operates in Sierra Leone.\n\nFrom its inception in 1888 until the start of the 21st century, De Beers controlled 80% to 85% of rough diamond distribution and was considered a monopoly.\\[4\\] By 2000, the company's control of the world diamond supply decreased to 63%.\\[5\\]\n\nThe company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes, who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M Rothschild & Sons bank.\\[6\\]\\[7\\] In 1926, Ernest Oppenheimer, a German immigrant to Britain and later South Africa who had earlier founded mining company Anglo American with American financier J. P. Morgan,\\[8\\] was elected to the board of De Beers.\\[9\\] He built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the diamond industry until he died in 1957. During this time, he was involved in several controversies, including price fixing and trust behaviour, and was accused of not releasing industrial diamonds for the US war effort during World War II.\\[10\\]\\[11\\]The company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes, who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M ...### South Africa's rough diamond trade\n\n-  Epstein, Edward Jay (February 1982). \"Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond?\". _The Atlantic Monthly_.

Today, I invite you to open a book—any book—and step through a door that never locks yet always leads somewhere new. Reading is not a hobby; it is a second life, cheaper than a plane ticket and wider than the sky.\n\nWhen I was eight, I hid under a quilt with a flashlight and a dog-eared copy of “Journey to the West.” Outside, my village had no streetlights and only one road out; inside those pages, I traveled on a flying cloud, fought demons, and discovered that courage can be borrowed from fictional monks and returned with interest. That night I learned the first secret of reading: it turns the small room of your childhood into a palace with endless corridors.\n\nYears later, science confirmed what every reader already feels in their bones. MRI scans show that when we read about the scent of rain on dry earth, the olfactory cortex lights up; when we read about a character stubbing a toe, the motor cortex winces. The brain, generous magician, rehearses every experience we give it. In other words, books let us practice being human without bruising actual skin.\n\nYet the statistics bruise us anyway. Last year, the average Chinese adult finished 4.76 books; on TikTok, the same person scrolled 1,200 hours. We are exchanging forests of nuance for feeds of noise. The cost is subtle but lethal: a vocabulary shrinks, a sympathy atrophies, a democracy grows more allergic to complexity. When we stop reading long-form, we stop reading long faces; we forget that people, unlike posts, cannot be swiped away.\n\nSo how do we reclaim the kingdom of print in the empire of swipe? Let me offer three practical rungs on the ladder back to literacy.\n\nFirst, tether reading to an existing habit. Place a book on your pillow each morning; you cannot sleep without moving it, and once it is in your hand, ten pages will do the rest. Second, read with a pencil. Margins are private battlefields where you argue with the author, and victory is measured in asterisks and exclamation points. Third, protect a daily “sacred quarter-hour.” Set a timer, silence the phone, and announce to your family: “I am unavailable unless the house is on fire—if it is, drag the bookshelf out first.”\n\nSome will say, “But I have no time.” I answer: we have 1,440 minutes a day; give 15 to books and you still own 96 percent of your life. Others protest, “But I read on my phone.” I reply: screens are windows; books are doors. Windows are for watching; doors are for crossing. Choose the architecture that actually moves you into another room.\n\nImagine if every citizen in this hall read just one extra book a month. That is 3.6 million new journeys taken, 3.6 million private revolutions started. One of them might design a greener battery; another might refuse a bribe; a third might simply forgive her father. Societies are not transformed by slogans but by stories that lodge too deep to uproot.\n\nIn the end, reading is not about impressing others with the height of your bookshelf; it is about defending the last private space that no algorithm can fully invade. It is the quiet declaration: “I still belong to myself.” So tonight, when the lights go off and the Wi-Fi blinks like a tired eye, reach for a book. Let the spine crack like a fireplace, let the letters warm your palms, and remember—every page is a passport, every reader a refugee who chooses to travel, chooses to stay, chooses finally to come home enlarged.\n\nClose the book, and you close a door; but the room you re-enter—your own life—will never be quite the same size again.\n\nThank you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Change it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Of course!

The title of my speech today is “The Joy of Reading.”\n\nReading is a marvelous journey across time and space. When I open a book, I seem to hear the echoes of history and feel the breath of the ancients. Reading *Records of the Grand Historian*, I see Sima Qian writing furiously in prison, recording a thousand years of events with his words. Reading *Dream of the Red Chamber*, I walk into the Grand View Garden and watch Baoyu and Daiyu perform joys and sorrows amid splendor. Reading *Journey to the West*, I join the Tang Monk and his disciples on the road to obtain the scriptures, subduing demons along the way, feeling persistence and courage. These stories let me, in just a few hours, experience the joys and sorrows of other people’s entire lives, gaining growth and wisdom.\n\nReading is also a dialogue with the great. When I read *Steve Jobs*, I saw how a dropout youth ignited the spark of innovation in a garage and finally changed the world. His story tells me: stay curious, dare to be different, and you can live your own brilliance. Reading *Madame Curie*, I saw a woman in a male-dominated scientific world win two Nobel Prizes through tenacity and wisdom. Her story made me understand: gender is not a limit, prejudice is not a shackle; if you hold on to your dream, you can break out of the cocoon and become a butterfly.\n\nReading is, even more, a baptism of the soul. When I feel lost, *The Little Prince* tells me: “What is essential is invisible to the eye”; one must feel with the heart. When I feel discouraged, *Kafka on the Shore* tells me: “Once you’ve weathered the storm, you are no longer the same person”; persevere and grow.

It lets us find a peaceful haven in a noisy world, discover direction in our bewildered youth, and uncover extraordinary meaning in ordinary life.\n\nLet us treasure every chance to open a book, and make reading a habit, a way of life. For the joy of reading is something no game, no short video can replace.

One morning, Grandma carried a bamboo basket and stood under the tree, gently shaking the branches. Golden flowers fell like rain, pattering into the basket. I leaned against the doorframe, urging her, “Hurry up, I have to go to school.” Grandma didn’t answer. She picked up the flowers one by one, carefully removing the stems and withered petals, her fingers moving as slowly as the clouds in the sky.\n\nAfter school, the kitchen was filled with a sweet scent. Grandma had spread the osmanthus on a bamboo sieve and placed it by the window to dry. The setting sun coated her silver hair with a layer of gold. I threw my backpack down and muttered, “Isn’t it just making osmanthus wine? Why take so many days?” Grandma smiled and handed me a cup of warm tea. “Good things need to wait.”\n\nI didn’t believe her. In my world, everything had to be fast—fast food, fast answers, fast grades. I even ate osmanthus candy in two bites, unable to taste anything.\n\nSeven days later, Grandma finally took out the clay jar. The dried osmanthus was mixed with rock sugar and white wine, layered gently, sealed, and hidden in the cool shade under the bed. Every week, she would uncover it, sniff it, and add a spoonful of honey. I watched her serious expression and suddenly felt that the jar seemed to hold not just flowers, but time itself.\n\nWhen the first snow fell, Grandma scooped out a small cup for me. The pale golden liquid glowed in the porcelain cup. I took a sip, and the fragrance bloomed on my tongue—layers of flowers, sunlight, and breeze. That moment, I seemed to hear the osmanthus blossoms falling in the autumn wind, saw Grandma’s gentle fingertips, and felt the days and nights quietly settling in the jar.\n\nI finally understood that “slow” is not procrastination, but a kind of respect—respect for ingredients, for time, for the people you love. That cup of osmanthus wine was Grandma’s way of teaching me: only when you slow down can beauty reveal its true shape.\n\nNow, every autumn, I still dry osmanthus under the sun. The golden flowers shine like fragments of time. I gently close the lid and let the scent of flowers and the scent of love ferment slowly in the quiet."}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

More application combinations for textured sintered stone  \nTextured sintered stone greatly enhances the material’s effect in home-design styles.  \n\nRecommended home-design styles  \n\n▼  \n\nJapandi style  \nJapandi blends Japanese and Scandinavian: rustic Japanese tradition meets clean Nordic minimalism, pursuing a calm, serene lifestyle felt through comfort. Japandi favors simple, natural, high-quality materials such as medium-tone wood, furniture paired with undecorated natural-textile fabrics like linen. Exquisite craftsmanship, classic ornaments and unique raw materials are integrated; simple, natural elements abound. Natural-touch wood-grain textured sintered stone complements Japandi elements perfectly.  \n\n▼  \n\nBrutalist style  \nIn Brutalist shaping, material choice is pronounced. To carry through Brutalism’s wild character, designers use rawer materials—exposed concrete, strongly grained timber, rustic terrazzo—making spaces more design-driven. This “wilderness” approach, matched with large-leaf greenery, brings nature indoors. Sintered stone that mimics natural materials, with near-authentic effects, conveys an art-and-life ambience through its own texture. Collisions of different materials create sharp contrast, echoing the overall palette and adding “beastly” vigor.  \n\nIV.

Conceptual Foundations  \nKrumboltz’s Social Learning Theory of Career Decision-Making (1979) posits that learning experiences—including academic coursework—shape both career beliefs and subsequent motivation to achieve in school. Lent, Brown & Hackett’s Social Cognitive Career Theory (1994) adds that increased career self-efficacy raises academic goal-setting and persistence, implying that career interventions can directly enhance achievement.\n\n2. Empirical Evidence  \n2.1 Quantitative findings  \n• A meta-analysis of 42 U.S. studies (Whiston et al., 2017) reported a small-to-moderate mean effect (g = 0.34) of structured career interventions on standardized test scores; effects were strongest when interventions exceeded five contact hours and included individualized feedback.  \n• Using longitudinal NELS:88 data, Hughes & Karp (2004) found that students completing a one-semester career development course recorded 0.18 SD higher GPA in 10th grade, controlling for prior achievement and SES.  \n• In a randomized controlled trial in Hong Kong (Yuen et al., 2010), Grade-9 students receiving a 10-week career curriculum scored 8 % higher in mathematics and 6 % higher in language examinations than controls at 6-month follow-up.  \n• Norwegian register data (Bakken & Elstad, 2019) show that participation in career guidance programs at age 15 predicts a 0.15 SD increase in GPA at age 16 and a 7 % rise in probability of completing upper-secondary education on time.\n\n2.2 Mediating mechanisms  \n• Academic relevance: Perry et al. (2022) demonstrate that career education raises course utility value (β = .38), which mediates 62 % of the effect on science grades.  \n• Self-efficacy: Turner & Lapan (2005) report that career interventions increase mathematics self-efficacy (Δ = 0.42 SD), which in turn predicts 21 % of the variance in algebra scores.  \n• Engagement: A three-wave Australian study (Bishop & Downes, 2019) shows that career planning activities reduce behavioral disengagement (β = –.29), indirectly lifting GPA through increased class participation.\n\n2.3 Moderating factors  \n• Dosage: Meta-regression indicates effect sizes plateau after 20–30 hours (Whiston et al., 2017).  \n• Timing: Interventions in early adolescence (Grades 7–9) yield larger achievement gains than senior-year programs (g = 0.41 vs. 0.19) (Hooley et al., 2021).  \n• Socio-economic status: Benefits are amplified for low-SES students (interaction β = .12) (Falco & Summers, 2019), suggesting compensatory effects.\n\n3. Theoretical Integration  \nCareer education appears to improve academic achievement primarily by enhancing utility value, self-efficacy, and future orientation, which jointly raise effort and strategic learning behaviors. The relationship is reciprocal: stronger academic performance further expands career options, reinforcing motivation (Sciarra & Ambrosino, 2019).\n\n4. Research Gaps  \nFew studies isolate subject-specific effects (STEM vs. humanities), use behavioral measures of achievement (e.g., homework time), or examine long-term tertiary outcomes. Experimental evidence outside Western contexts remains scarce, and the role of digital career platforms is under-explored.\n\n5. Conclusion  \nThe convergent evidence indicates that well-designed career education programs produce statistically significant, educationally meaningful gains in academic achievement, with effect sizes comparable to other school-based psychosocial interventions. Optimizing dosage, timing, and integration with subject teaching emerges as the critical pathway for maximizing both career development and academic outcomes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "functions.search:0", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "search", "arguments": "{\"queries\":[\"career education academic performance relationship\",\"impact of career education on academic outcomes\",\"career education and student achievement literature review\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Historical tool_call results have been hidden", "name": "search", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Literature Review  \nCareer Education and Academic Achievement: What Does the Empirical Evidence Say?\n\n1. Conceptual background  \nCareer-education programmes are designed to help students understand the relationships between schooling, post-school pathways and labour-market demand. Theoretically, such programmes raise academic achievement by strengthening three proximal variables:  \n(a) academic self-efficacy – the belief that one can succeed on specific academic tasks;  \n(b) learning engagement – behavioural, emotional and cognitive investment in schoolwork; and  \n(c) career adaptability – the psychosocial resources (control, concern, curiosity, confidence) that help students turn career intentions into concrete educational goals (Pang et al., 2025).\n\n2. Magnitude and consistency of achievement effects  \nA 2016 international review located 45 methodologically sound studies (67 discrete interventions) that measured the impact of career education on “educational achievement” (Education & Employers, 2016). Sixty per cent reported statistically significant positive effects, none found negative effects, and the remainder were mixed or null. Five UK studies that used the same outcome metric—GCSE point scores—showed “relatively modest” but reliable gains for students exposed to benchmark-aligned career provision. A separate evaluation of the Gatsby Benchmark pilot in England found that learners in schools that embedded career learning in the curriculum achieved “significantly better” GCSE results than matched controls (Uptree, 2022).\n\n3. Mechanism 1: academic self-efficacy  \nA 2025 study of 848 Chinese senior-high students tested a sequential mediation model in which career-education participation predicted academic self-efficacy both directly (β = 0.056, p < 0.01) and indirectly through two pathways:  \n- Career adaptability → self-efficacy (indirect effect = 0.078, p < 0.001)  \n- Career adaptability → learning engagement → self-efficacy (indirect effect = 0.088, p < 0.001)  \nTogether the indirect effects accounted for 81 % of the total effect (Pang et al., 2025). Earlier qualitative work in the UK reported parallel findings: teachers observed that pupils who received mentor-supported career guidance showed higher coursework completion rates and described themselves as “more confident learners” (Miller, 1999, cited in Education & Employers, 2016).\n\n4. Mechanism 2: engagement and goal clarity  \nEmbedding career examples in subject teaching reduces the ubiquitous “what’s the point?” reaction, thereby raising behavioural engagement (Uptree, 2022). When students understand that, for example, a grade B in mathematics is required for an audit apprenticeship, they set more specific proximal targets and invest greater effort in class (Killeen, White & Watts, 1999). The same mechanism—clear career goals → attainable educational goals → increased effort—has been replicated in US career-academy evaluations and Australian school-to-work pathway studies (Hughes et al., 2004; Hooley et al., 2014).\n\n5. Moderators and boundary conditions  \nPositive effects are strongest when:  \n- career interventions are sustained (multiple contacts across more than one school year);  \n- provision is benchmark-aligned (e.g., Gatsby Benchmarks) and integrated into subject teaching rather than delivered as stand-alone sessions; and  \n- participants are in the 14–16 age range, where academic choices directly constrain post-school options (Education & Employers, 2016).  \nEffects are weaker when programmes are brief, optional, or delivered to students younger than 12, presumably because the link between current effort and distal occupational rewards is too abstract.\n\n6. Gaps and future directions  \n- Longitudinal evidence: most existing studies are cross-sectional or cover <18 months; longitudinal designs are needed to confirm causal ordering.  \n- Objective attainment measures: a sizeable proportion of research relies on self-reported grades or self-efficacy proxies; more studies should use administrative transcript data.  \n- Non-Western contexts: although the 2025 Chinese study begins to fill the gap, evidence from Africa, Latin America and South Asia remains scarce.  \n- Online delivery: virtually no experimental work has examined whether digital career-guidance platforms raise achievement to the same extent as face-to-face provision.\n\n7. Conclusion  \nThe empirical literature published since the late 1990s converges on three conclusions:  \n1. Career education does not harm, and usually enhances, academic achievement.  \n2. Benefits are mediated by increased academic self-efficacy, learning engagement and career adaptability.  \n3. Programmes that are embedded, benchmark-aligned and delivered in early adolescence yield the most consistent, albeit modest, gains in standardised attainment.\n\nReferences  \nEducation and Employers (2016). *Careers education: International literature review*.

Before you head out, here are some key things to keep in mind to ensure a safe and successful start.\n\n### Start Small and Learn Slowly\n\nIt’s tempting to dive in and try to identify everything at once, but foraging is best learned a few plants at a time. Choose 2 to 3 common, easy-to-identify wild edibles that grow in your area, and get to know them really well. Learn their:\n\n-  Leaf shape\n\n-  Growth habit\n\n-  Flowers or seeds\n\n-  Seasonal changes\n\n-  Preferred habitat\n\nMastering a handful of plants builds confidence and keeps you safe from potentially harmful mistakes.\n\n### Beware of Lookalikes\n\nMany edible wild plants have toxic or even deadly doubles. For example:\n\n-  Wild carrot (Queen Anne’s lace) looks similar to poison hemlock.\n\n-  Edible berries can resemble inedible or mildly toxic ones.\n\n-  Wild garlic and lily-of-the-valley may grow near one another but have drastically different effects if eaten.\n\nAlways cross-reference with trusted sources and never eat a plant unless you’re 100% sure of its identity.\n\n### Use Multiple ID Resources\n\nOne photo in a guidebook or app isn’t enough to safely identify a plant. Use at least two or three of the following:\n\n-  **Regional field guides** with detailed photos\n\n-  **Foraging books** specific to your climate\n\n-  **Mobile apps** like Seek by iNaturalist (for confirmation, not sole ID)\n\n-  **Local plant walks** or guided tours\n\n-  **Online foraging groups** with experienced moderators\n\nThe more angles and expert input you have, the better your chances of making a safe identification.\n\n### Train Your Eyes and Pay Attention to Patterns\n\nGet used to really looking at plants, their location, the type of soil they grow in, and their relationship to sun, water, and other plants. This kind of observation helps you spot edible plants and notice changes across the seasons.## Use it as a Foraging Classroom\n\nYour backyard is a perfect place to practice plant ID without pressure. Here’s how to make the most of it:\n\n-  **Create a photo log** or journal of plants as they emerge through the seasons.\n\n-  **Mark out areas** where certain wild plants grow and return to them to observe changes.\n\n-  **Practice identifying edible plants** at various stages, such as leaves, flowers, seeds, and so on.\n\nOnce you’ve built your confidence in your own space, you’ll be better prepared to recognize wild edibles in nearby woods, trails, and beyond.\n\n## Helpful Next Steps\n\nOnce you’ve gotten started, here are a few simple ways to deepen your foraging skills and confidence:\n\n-  **Take an Online Foraging Course:** If this guide has sparked your interest in foraging, you’ll love The Herbal Academy’s Online Foraging Course. It offers in-depth training on how to confidently recognize, harvest, and use wild edibles, complete with seasonal tips, safety advice, and vibrant visuals.\n\n-  **Start a Foraging Journal:** Keep a small notebook or digital log of what you find, where it grows, and when. Use your journal to record plant names, habitat notes, photos, and whether you harvested or observed.\n\n-  **Join a Local Foraging Group:** Look for local plant walks, foraging clubs, or online communities. Many experienced foragers are happy to share knowledge, swap tips, and help ID plants.\n\n-  **Follow Seasonal Foraging Guides:** Understanding seasonal changes helps you know what to expect and when. Spring greens, summer berries, and fall nuts each have their season.\n\n## Final Foraging Thoughts\n\nBackyard and woodland foraging for food is a beautiful way to reconnect with nature, slow down, and rediscover what’s growing around you. Start simple, stay safe, and take your time learning. You’ll be amazed at how much abundance is just outside your door.\n\nWant more foraging tips and seasonal guides?

Norris\n[日期]: 2025-03-20\n片段 1：\n## Rules of Foraging for Wild Edibles\n\n### Know Your Trees\n\nBeing able to identify certain varieties of trees can greatly help when foraging for mushrooms. This is the first tip that Whitney tells people who want to get started foraging for mushrooms.\n\nThere's a mycorrhizal relationship between mushrooms and trees. Therefore, you can start to learn which variety of mushrooms and which varieties.\n\nFor example, **morels** are generally found around **cottonwoods** in the Pacific Northwest, while morels hang out around **sycamore** and **slippery elm trees** in Appalachia. If you're planning to go forage for morels, you'll want to know where these trees grow.\n\nWhitney shared that **chanterelle** mushrooms grow great around **beech** or **elk forests** in the Appalachia or **hemlock trees** in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nTo learn more about tree identification, you can pick up a regional field guide or learn some basic tree identification skills online (Whitney recommends Adam Harrison's YouTube channel, **Learn Your Land** and check out his **Trees in All Seasons** tree identification course).\n\nYou could also download and use the app **Picture This** to help with tree identification.\n\n### Know How to Prepare Wild Edibles\n\nBeyond foraging for wild edibles, you need to know the proper and safe way to prepare your them. For example, you should never eat wild mushrooms raw. You should always thoroughly cook them to kill any bacteria that may be on them.\n\nFor some wild edibles, the fruit is safe to eat, but the leaves are not (e.g., rhubarb). Other plants, such as elderberries, have toxic berries when consumed raw, but when cooked into an **elderberry syrup**, they're packed with healing properties.\n\nYou can learn **how to grow elderberries from cuttings** here, **how to grow and care for elderberries** here, and **how to prune elderberries** here. Then, learn about these **25+ ways to use elderberries**.\n\nWhenever you're preparing a new foraged edible, use a reliable recipe for cooking and eating instructions.## Wild Edibles to Forage For\n\n\n\n-  **Asparagus** – We foraged for wild asparagus and canned up over 25 quarts of **pickled asparagus**.\n\n-  **Autumn Olive Berry** – These berries are great for both sweet and savory dishes and come from the autumn olive tree.\n\n-  **Cattails** – Easy to identify and a major wild food source. Every part can be used in some helpful way, which is really awesome.\n\n-  **Chanterelle Mushroom** – One of the most famous of all the wild edible mushrooms, golden chanterelle mushrooms are easy to hunt and identify after you know them.\n\n-  **Chicory** – Makes a fantastic coffee substitute!\n\n-  **Chickweed** – This is the second plant I ever learned how to forage. It's a dainty little plant with white flowers. It's a tasty addition to salads or used as an herbal garnish (similar to parsley).\n\n-  **Chokecherries**(not chokeberries) – Chokecherries are just one of several small-fruited, edible cherries. They grow as medium sized trees, or more often, as multi-stemmed shrubs.\n\n-  **Dandelion** – Though just a weed to many, dandelion can be used for food or medicine. My favorite is to eat the greens in a salad and make a **dandelion healing balm**.\n\n-  **Elderberry** – One of my favorites. So much so that I've been taking cuttings and planting more and more around my property.\n\n-  **Field Pennycress** – “This plant is sometimes cultivated as a food crop in Europe. There has been some research done on the potential of field pennycress as a biofuel.”\n\n-  **Garlic Mustard** – This is a cruciferous vegetable, but most recognize it as an invasive weed.\n\n-  **Japanese Knotweed** – Also known as an invasive species. Yet it's edible and makes a tasty juice for cooking!\n\n-  **Hawthorn Berry** – Hawthorn should not be used if you're on any kind of medication for your heart. Otherwise, it's great for making tea or jelly.\n\n-  **Hazelnuts** – If you happen upon a hazelnut tree, you're in luck! These are some of the most delicious nuts, but they do require a bit of work to dry and shell.\n\n-  **Hickory Nuts** – Also known as pecans. With a bit of tree identification skills, you should be able to locate a tree near you!## Wild Edibles to Forage For\n\n\n\n-  **Hazelnuts** – If you happen upon a hazelnut tree, you're in luck! These are some of the most delicious nuts, but they do require a bit of work to dry and shell.\n\n-  **Hickory Nuts** – Also known as pecans. With a bit of tree identification skills, you should be able to locate a tree near you!\n\n-  **Juniper Berries** – Commonly known as being a spice or being the flavoring for gin, they have many other uses as well! Foraging for juniper berries is easy, as juniper trees are fairly common.\n\n-  **Lambs Quarters** – One of the first edibles we can forage for in early spring! It can be used like spinach (but has even more nutritional benefits).\n\n-  **Lion's Mane Mushroom**(similar to Bearhead's Mushroom) – This is one of the more interesting-looking types of mushrooms. In place of the traditional mushroom cap is a large clump of teeth, which are spine-like structures a few millimeters long.\n\n-  **Lobster Mushrooms** – “Lobster mushrooms are really cool looking, and unmistakable once you know what they look like. They are most often found in the fall after the rains come, but in some areas can be found in the summertime as well.”\n\n-  **Miner's Lettuce** – “Miner’s lettuce is a wild-growing edible weed that is highly nutritious. Also known as claytonia or “winter purslane,” this plant is loaded with vitamin C and minerals and has medicinal properties. Plus, miner’s lettuce is a delicious addition to salads and soups!”\n\n-  **Morel Mushrooms** – These were the first things my father taught me how to forage, and I taught my children.\n\n-  **Nettle Leaf** – This is found all over the place in the Pacific Northwest. I love using it for tea.\n\n-  **Oregon Grape** – The Oregon grape isn’t technically a grape at all but a bush in the barberry family that has edible berries and medicinal properties.\n\n-  **Purslane** – “Native to India and the Middle East, purslane now grows around the world, including the United States.”\n\n-  **Rose Hips** – Not all roses produce rosehips. Many of the more popular roses have been modified for the hips to be bred out!\n\n[搜索关键词]:edible plants by region climate\n\n[编号]:[^4^]\n[标题]:Exploring Edible Plants Native to the Southeast U.S.\n[网站名称]:The National Wildlife Federation Blog\n[日期]: 2025-06-26\n片段 1：\nAlmost everything grown for food and agriculture today is the product of thousands of years of breeding. Farmers of the past domesticated crop plants by selecting desirable traits to pass on to subsequent generations, and with time, achieved richer, tastier food. Meanwhile, Indigenous Peoples bred wild grasses, legumes, bushes, and trees, and gave way to a diverse array of edible plants, contributing to the region’s rich culinary heritage. In this blog, we will explore five notable plants that have roots in the Southeast and delve into their origin, flavors, and cultural significance.\n\nMuscadine (Vitis rotundifolia).\n\n**Origin:** Muscadines are noted as the first native grape species to be cultivated in North America. They thrive in warm, humid climates, and can be seen in the wild spanning from Florida north to Delaware, and west to Texas.\n\n**Taste:** Muscadines are known for their uniquely bold, sweet flavor with a hint of tartness. When ripe, the muscadine’s thick skin encases a juicy, fragrant pulp that varies from green to dark purple or black.\n\n**Significance:** Muscadines are a staple in southern cuisine, and are not only enjoyed raw, but in wines, jellies, and desserts. They are said to be easier to grow than other grape species due to their thick skin that protects them from pests, bacteria, and fungi.\n\nMuscadines even have medicinal value; the Seminole Nation used them to aid fever, vomiting, snake bites, and chronic illness in children. Their resilience and adaptability make them a staple in Southern gardens and cuisine, celebrated for their antioxidant properties as well.\n\nPecan (Carya illinoinensis).\n\n**Origin:** Pecans are known as the only major tree nut that grows naturally in North America. With a native of range spanning from Indiana and Illinois south to Louisiana and Texas, Pecan trees enjoy areas with warm, humid climates that have long, hot summers and cool winters.\n\n**Taste:** Pecans feature a buttery, nutty flavor with a slightly sweet finish. Their rich, creamy texture makes them a favorite in both savory and sweet dishes.\n\n**Significance:** As the state nut of Texas and a key ingredient in Southern cooking, pecans are essential for desserts like pies, cakes, and candies. Historically, they have played an important role in the diet of Native American tribes with them documented being roasted, ground into flour, boiled, and used to make nut milk.\n\nPecans continue to be a significant agricultural product in the region as the U.S. accounts for around 80% of global pecan production. They are valued for their nutritional benefits, being rich in healthy fats and antioxidants, and being a tasty ingredient in family-favorite dishes.\n\nPawpaw (Asimina triloba).\n\n**Origin:** Pawpaws are the largest fruit native to the U.S. and its genus is the only one of its family not to be confined to growing in tropical areas naturally. Pawpaws are found in the wild of Eastern North America, ranging from southern Canada to northern Florida, and west to parts of Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska. They usually thrive as understory trees in forests with moist, fertile floodplain soils near rivers and creeks.\n\n**Taste:** Pawpaws have a custard-like texture and a flavor that is often described as a blend of banana, mango, and melon. They are sweet, creamy, and fragrant when ripe.\n\n**Significance:** As the largest edible fruit native to North America, pawpaws have a special place in the diets of many Indigenous Peoples. They are often referred to as the “princess of fruits” and the Shawnee Tribe even recognizes September as “ pawpaw month.” Native Americans ate the fruit raw, dried them into cakes, and used the bark to make rope, nets, and mats.\n\nPersimmon (Diospyros virginiana).\n\n**Origin:** American persimmons grow from Florida to Connecticut, west to Iowa and south Texas. Persimmon trees can grow in a variety of settings ranging from swampy forests to sandy soils, as they are well-adapted to extreme temperatures and tolerant to adverse conditions.\n\n**Taste:** Ripe persimmons have a sweet, honey-like taste with notes of cinnamon and vanilla, while unripe persimmons are tart and astringent.\n\n**Significance:** Persimmons, often referred to as “sugar fruit” in some cultures, have been a staple among many Native American communities and continue to be enjoyed in various culinary applications, from desserts to sauces. They are also valued for their high vitamin content and suitability for various climates in the Southeast.\n\nBlueberry (Vaccinium virgatum).\n\n", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now let me get more detailed information about edible plants and their nutritional benefits:", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "id": "functions.search:1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "search", "arguments": "{\"queries\": [\"edible plants nutritional value vitamins minerals\", \"medicinal edible plants health benefits\", \"edible plants preparation cooking methods\", \"toxic plants avoid poisonous lookalikes\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[搜索关键词]:edible plants nutritional value vitamins minerals\n\n[编号]:[^5^]\n[标题]:Nutritional composition of some wild edible plants consumed in Southwest Ethiopia\n[网站名称]:ScienceDirect\n[日期]: 2025-07-16\n片段 1：\nSkip to main content Skip to article\n\nScienceDirect home pageSign In\n\n-  View **PDF**\n\n## Research article  Nutritional composition of some wild edible plants consumed in Southwest Ethiopia\n\nUnder a Creative Commons license\n\nOpen access\n\n## Abstract\n\nWild Edible Plants (WEPs), namely Chaw ( _Solanum nigrum_ L.), Shutamodoroy ( _Vigna membranacea_ A. Rich), Entut ( _Dioscorea praehensilis_ Benth.), Gagut ( _Trilepisium madagascariense_ D.C.), and Tikawoch ( _Cleome gynandra_ L.), are naturally grown WEPs and are consumed by the Meinit cultural community in the Bench Maji zone of southwest Ethiopia. However, their nutritional and anti-nutritional compositions of these WEPs have not been documented. In this regard, the proximate, mineral and anti-nutrient contents of the edible portions of these WEPs were analyzed using standard food analysis methods. The nutritional analysis revealed that the WEPs contain valuable nutrients in the following ranges: protein (4.0–21.7%), fat (0.7–6.1%), fiber (8.9–22.3%), carbohydrates (38.1–83%) and energy (275–371.1 kcal/100 g). These WEPs were also rich in macro and micro minerals such as calcium (3.7–594.8 mg/100 g), potassium (440.6–1487.8 mg/100 g), sodium (174.9–277.4 mg/100 g), magnesium (68.2–588.1 mg/100 g), iron (0.8–38.5 mg/100 g), zinc (2.4–5.9 mg/100 g) and copper (0.1–0.5 mg/100 g). The phytate, condensed tannin, and oxalate content of WEPs varied from 8.6 to 307.3 mg/100 g, 5.8–329.0 mg/100 g, and 43.7–443.9 mg/100 g, respectively. The result indicated that these WEPs are rich sources of nutrients that could help combat nutrient deficiencies, particularly in rural communities. The results of this study can be used as baseline information for the nutraceuticals industry and community-based nutrition practitioners.\n\n## Keywords\n\nAnti-nutritional content\n\nMineral analysis\n\nNutrient composition\n\nWild edible plants\n\nLoading...\n\n## Cited by (0)\n\n© 2023 The Authors.

The only mRNAs lacking poly(A) tails are the metazoan replication‐dependent histone mRNAs which protect their 3′‐ends with a stem‐loop structure and which are processed by the U7 snRNP complex \\[ 123\\]. In all other protein‐coding transcripts, poly(A) tails protect them from nuclear degradation, stimulate translation, and play a central role in their controlled degradation in the cytoplasm \\[ 124, 125\\].\n\nAfter their initial synthesis in the nucleus, poly(A) tails undergo gradual shortening (deadenylation) catalyzed by RNA deadenylase enzymes. Complete removal of the tail releases poly(A)‐bound PABPs triggering decapping and degradation of the mRNA from both 5′ and 3′‐ends \\[ 126, 127, 128\\]. Indeed, the varying poly(A) tail lengths observed in total mRNA ensembles reflect a mixture of different aged molecules each deadenylated with an mRNA‐, cell type‐ and condition‐specific rate \\[ 77, 129, 130, 131\\]. The variations in deadenylation rates are governed by, for example, the recruitment of deadenylases and their co‐factors, translation efficiency, and RNA localization \\[ 125\\]. A textbook view is that the removal of the poly(A) tail is the rate‐limiting step in mRNA degradation \\[ 126\\], which is supported by recent studies in mouse fibroblasts and yeast \\[ 127, 130\\]. Assuming this model, the defined initial tail length, ensured by the nuclear length control systems, contribute to establishing precise mRNA half‐lives by fixing the number of adenosines that need to be removed before degradation occurs \\[ 61\\]. However, this direct relationship between poly(A) tail lengths and RNA half‐lives is confounded by observations that deadenylation rates vary across the length of the poly(A) tail, and short‐tailed mRNAs display large variation in their degradation rates \\[ 125, 130, 131, 132\\]. Furthermore, these rates can exist within a regime in which RNA degradation is temporally uncoupled from deadenylation \\[ 133\\]. Nevertheless, the corollary of the observed global poly(A) tail length control is that all mRNAs enter the deadenylation process from the same starting point.\n\n[搜索关键词]:RNA's polyA tail\n\n[编号]:[^3^]\n[标题]:poly-A tail | Learn Science at Scitable\n[网站名称]:Nature\n[日期]: \n片段 1：\nThe poly-A tail is a long\nchain of adenine nucleotides that is added to a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule\nduring RNA processing to increase the stability of the molecule.

Then an\nenzyme called poly-A polymerase adds a chain of adenine nucleotides to the RNA.\nThis process, called polyadenylation, adds a poly-A tail that is between 100\nand 250 residues long. The poly-A tail makes the RNA molecule more stable and\nprevents its degradation.

Introduction\n\nEarly studies on eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) were quick to note that these emissaries of the genetic code are polyadenylated on their 3′-end1– 6. Poly(A) tails are present on almost every eukaryotic mRNA, with the only known exception being some mammalian histone transcripts. Poly(A) tails are added co-transcriptionally in the nucleus and are required for the export of mature mRNAs into the cytoplasm ( Figure 1). Eukaryotic transcripts receive a poly(A) tail with an average length of ~200 nt in mammals7 and ~70 nt in yeast8.## II. Poly(A) tails in mRNA translation\n\n### A. Role of PABPC\n\nIn the cytoplasm, poly(A) tails are bound by PABPC35, which was discovered at about the same time as mRNAs were found to bear a poly(A) tail36, 37. There is one cytoplasmic PABPC in yeast (Pab1), but multiple isoforms in mammals: PABPC1 is the best-studied mammalian isoform and likely the most abundant in most cell types38. Other mammalian isoforms include PABPC4 which may act in a transcript-specific manner, embryonic ePABP and the testes-specific tPABP38. PABPC is highly conserved in eukaryotes and has four N-terminal RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domains that bind poly(A) RNA with a nanomolar affinity39 ( Figure 2A). RRMs 1 and 2 have a higher affinity and specificity for poly(A) than RRMs 3 and 440, 41. A crystal structure of RRMs 1 and 2 showed that RRM1 is located 3′ of RRM2 on the RNA42 ( Figure 2A). The RRMs are followed by a proline-rich linker and a C-terminal Mademoiselle (MLLE) domain ( Figure 2A). The MLLE domain recognizes a peptide motif called poly(A)-interacting motif 2 (PAM2) which is found in a number of partner proteins that regulate poly(A) tail dynamics39. Nuclear-localized poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPN1 humans, Nab2 in yeast) have a different domain architecture to cytoplasmic PABPCs and influence the process of polyadenylation.

Though this was confirmed in our analysis by the absolute level of poly(A)+ RNA, especially for highly expressed mRNAs, we found no global correlation between absolute changes in mean poly(A) tail length and fold changes in RNA abundance for the _pap1-1_, _pap1-1 rrp6Δ_, and _pap1-1 trf4Δ_ backgrounds (Fig. 2e–g, for single-gene examples see Fig. 2h, and Supplemental Fig. 2f). The lack of such correlation indicates that some mRNAs are adenylated correctly in _pap1-1_, and the steady-state mRNA abundance/poly(A) tail length pattern results from other nuclear or cytoplasmic compensatory mechanisms.\n\n[搜索关键词]:RNA的polyA尾巴\n\n[编号]:[^7^]\n[标题]:环状circular RNA|miRNA|mRNA|RNA|蛋白质|核糖体|细胞|基因|-健康界\n[网站名称]:中国医疗器械网\n[日期]: 2023-06-19\n片段 1：\nceRNA：competing endogenous RNAs，内源竞争RNA，ceRNA可以通过应答元件(microRNA response elements，MREs)与microRNA结合从而影响microRNA导致的基因沉默。\n\n还有一个就是我们接下来要学习的circRNAs\n\n**二、circRNAs(Circular RNAs，环状RNA)**\n\ncircRNAs(Circular RNAs，环状RNA)是一类不具有5’未端帽子和3’末端poly(A)尾巴、由常规基因经过剪切，并以共价键形成环形结构的非编码RNA分子。含miRNA应答元件(miRNAresponse element，MRE)，可充当竞争性内源RNA(competing endogenousRNA，ceRNA)，与miRNA结合，在细胞中起到miRNA海绵的作用，进而解除miRNA对其靶基因的抑制作用，上调靶基因的表达水平。\n\nPS:大多数真核成熟的mRNA分子具有典型的5’-端的7-甲基鸟苷三磷酸（m7GTP）帽子结构和3’-端的多聚腺苷酸(polyA)尾巴结构。circRNAs不具有5’未端帽子和3’末端poly(A)尾巴。\n\ncircular RNA研究历程\n\n环状RNA形成\n\n成熟的线性mRNA分子\n\n具有典型的5‘端帽子结构和3’端的polyA尾巴。\n\n图中circular RNA单个外显子成环、2个外显子夹杂内含子成环、多个外显子成环均已经标出；circular RNA三个显著特征：环状结构、无Poly A尾巴、非编码RNA。\n\n相比线性mRNA分子，环状RNA生物稳定性高.环状RNA生物学功能\n\nmiRNA海绵：环状可以吸附大量miRNA;蛋白海绵：可以吸附大量蛋白;翻译蛋白。Circular RNA可以翻译成相应蛋白\n\nCircular RNA能够和特定的miRNA结合，从而阻止miRNA去降解特定的mRNA，miRNA的一个重要功能是结合到特定mRNA的3’端，从而降解相应的mRNA。所以Circular RNA和相应的miRNA结合之后就可以调节mRNA的表达。\n\n[搜索关键词]:RNA的polyA尾巴\n\n[编号]:[^8^]\n[标题]:Nano3P-seq: transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression and tail dynamics using end-capture nanopore cDNA sequencing\n[网站名称]:Nature\n[日期]: 2022-12-19\n片段 1：\n## Results\n\n### Nano3P-seq robustly captures both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNA\n\nBecause nanopore sequencing is typically limited to the analysis of polyA+ RNA molecules (Fig. 1a), previous efforts have opted to perform in vitro polyadenylation reactions of the total RNA to capture non-polyadenylated RNA in the sequencing run16. While this option can capture any given transcript present in the sample, it also leads to a loss of polyA tail length information. Therefore, we reasoned that by coupling template switching to cDNA nanopore sequencing, we would simultaneously capture the polyA+ and polyA− transcriptome, while retaining polyA tail length information from each individual RNA molecule (Fig. 1a).\n\n**Fig. 1: Nano3P-seq captures polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs, while retaining polyA tail length information.**\n\n**a**, Schematic overview comparing three different library preparation methods for studying the transcriptome using nanopore sequencing.

Our results show that Nano3P-seq efficiently captures both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNA molecules, as well as the diversity of polyA tail lengths in individual RNAs (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We then examined the performance of Nano3P-seq on in vivo samples, and sequenced total RNA samples from mouse brain, previously enriched in nuclear and mitochondrial content via subcellular fractionation to increase the content of non-coding RNAs17 ( Methods). We confirmed that Nano3P-seq captured RNA biotypes that are typically polyadenylated (that is, mRNA, long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), and processed transcript) as well as non-polyadenylated (that is rRNA, miscellaneous RNA (miscRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)), the majority of them being rRNA, mRNA, and snRNA (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1d). In addition, our results confirmed that polyA tail length information was retained in individual reads. Specifically, the majority of reads corresponding to mRNAs had polyA tails (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1e,f), whereas non-coding RNAs such as snoRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 1f) and snRNAs did not have polyA tails (Extended Data Fig. 1g), as expected.\n\n[搜索关键词]:RNA的polyA尾巴\n\n[编号]:[^9^]\n[标题]:Role of an RNA pseudoknot involving the polyA tail in replication of Pepino mosaic potexvirus and related plant viruses\n[网站名称]:Nature\n[日期]: 2022-07-07\n片段 1：\n## Results\n\n### Effect of polyA-length on replication in vivo\n\nFull size image\n\nAs the polyA tail is also necessary for translation, an essential early process in PepMV infection, it is likely that the number of As will also affect translation. In an attempt to differentiate the effects of polyA tail-length on replication and translation, templates were made in which a _Renilla_ luciferase gene was fused to the PepMV 3′ UTR that incorporated a polyA tail of 2, 6, or 25 As. Capped RNA transcripts synthesized from these templates were transfected into _N. benthamiana_ protoplasts and luciferase activity as a measure of protein translation was determined 16 h post-transfection. The presence of 2 As resulted in very low levels of translation (~ 5%), whereas translation of the transcript incorporating 6 As was only twofold less than the wt RNA with 25 As (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that the low replication observed with a polyA tail of 6 nts is mainly attributable to a decrease in minus-strand RNA synthesis, rather than to diminished translation.\n\n[搜索关键词]:RNA的polyA尾巴\n\n[编号]:[^10^]\n[标题]:Evaluation of two main RNA-seq approaches for gene quantification in clinical RNA sequencing: polyA+ selection versus rRNA depletion\n[网站名称]:Nature\n[日期]: 2018-03-19\n片段 1：\n## Results\n\n### Accuracy in gene quantification between polyA+ selection and rRNA depletion RNA-seq\n\nThe expressions of a subset of histone genes are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. The majority of histone genes are known to be expressed as replication-dependent polyA− transcripts28, 29, and thus the majority of them are barely detected in the polyA+ selection RNA-seq. However, a small number of histone genes did show appreciable expression in the polyA+ selection method, and _HIST1H2AC_ is a case in point (Supplementary Fig. S4). Indeed, the expression of _HIST1H2AC_ in _Blood\\_PolyA_ was as high as 151 counts per million. We speculated that _HIST1H2AC_ had a polyA+ tail, and the 3′-end sequencing confirmed a polyA+ signature in _HIST1H2AC_ (Supplementary Fig. S5). Recently, it has been reported that a subset of histone genes produces polyA+ mRNAs under a variety of cellular conditions30, 31. Therefore, whether a gene has a polyA+ tail is not simply black and white, and likely to be more complicated and dynamic than was first thought.\n\nThe small RNAs, _RN7SL2_, _RN7SL3_, and _SNORD3A_, displayed very high expression levels in the rRNA depletion RNA-seq (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S1). _SNORD3A_ is a known abundant small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) involved in the processing of rRNA precursors32. _RN7SL2_ and _RN7SL3_ are part of the signal recognition particle complex, which mediates the cotranslational insertion of secretory proteins into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum33. The exceptionally high expressions of these small RNAs in HEK293 cell line and extracellular vesicles have also been reported16, 34. The _RN7SL2_ reads accounted for about 88% (in blood) and 84% (in colon) of reads derived from small RNAs. Sultan _et al_.16 reported exceptionally high expression of _RN7SL1_ rather than _RNSL2_. _RN7SL1_, _RN7SL2_, and _RN7SL3_ are paralogous genes, and sequence comparison revealed they share high sequence identity.\n\n", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

Think ILM/Disney+ series texture: 4-8K native rendering, full path-traced lighting, sub-surface skin, micro-thread cloth, bespoke muscle rigs, fluid sims for every spell, and bespoke Houdini FX passes that run for weeks per shot. Each 24-minute episode would command roughly 14–16 million USD, matching or beating the per-minute spend of “Avatar: The Last Airbender” live-action or “Star Wars: Visions” shorts. Assets would be built once at film fidelity, then reused across the cour, letting the team pour money into shot-specific polish instead of just building models.\n\nCharacter count would stay tight—maybe 12 hero rigs, 30 mid-tier, 200 background—but every hero asset would get a 400-bone face rig, FACS blend-shapes, and a proprietary hair groom that can survive close-ups in 8K. Cloth is full Marvelous-to-Houdini pipeline; capes and silks sim on top of muscle caches, then run through a second QC pass in Katana. Environments are megascans mixed with hand-sculpted displacement: one establishing cliff city can eat 6 TB of texture tiles, but because the budget allows a 500-person floor across four studios (Chengdu, Suzhou, Vancouver, L.A.), the disk cost is trivial. Comp shots average 120 layers; every spell gets its own Nuke script, and the final grade is a 64-bit HDR Dolby Vision pass.\n\nOn the audio side, you’re recording a 96-piece Chinese orchestra at Avatar Studios in New York, plus a 40-member throat-singing choir from Inner Mongolia. Foley is captured on a Zhangjiajie stone ridge for natural reverb, then sweetened at Skywalker Ranch. Dubbing cycles three takes per line minimum; ADR is done on 192-kHz mics so the down-sampled 48 kHz keeps ultrasonic air. Mix is Atmos 7.1.4, delivered in both theatrical and streaming stems.\n\nScheduling: 22 months pre-pro, 14 months shot production, 4 months final grade and sound. That’s possible because the 100 million per episode buys parallel pipelines; episode 1 is in final comp while episode 9 is still in layout. Director has final say on every shot, and the budget covers a “no-questions-asked” retake fund equal to 8 % of the episode cost—about 8 million RMB—so anything that doesn’t screen-perfect is simply re-done.\n\nPlace this against current Chinese titles: “Ne Zha” (2019) cost ~60 million RMB for 110 minutes; you are spending 1.3 times that for each 24-minute block. “White Snake” (2019) came in at ~80 million RMB for 99 minutes; your per-minute burn is 5× higher. Even the flashiest Tencent seasonals (“Douluo Dalu,” “Qin Shi Mingyue”) top out around 2–3 million RMB per episode; you outspend them by 30–50×. The only remotely comparable spend in Asia is Studio Ghibli’s “Earwig and the Witch” TV budget, but that was still sub-4 million USD per half-hour—and TV anime pipelines, not feature CG.\n\nBottom line: visual fidelity would sit between “Avatar 2” and a Pixar feature, but delivered every week for three months.

Clarify the positioning of the two libraries\n- **transformers**: a **general-purpose pre-trained model library** developed by Hugging Face, supporting **all kinds of NLP tasks** (classification, generation, QA, etc.) such as BERT, GPT, T5.\n- **sentence-transformers** (SBERT) is an **extension library built on transformers**, **specialized in sentence-level embeddings**, optimized for semantic similarity, text retrieval, etc.\n\n\n#### 2. Core differences\n\n| **Dimension**         | **transformers**                          | **sentence-transformers**                     |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Design goal**       | General NLP tasks (multi-task support)   | Specialized in sentence semantic embeddings (single-objective optimization) |\n| **Model architecture**| Native pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) | Adds **pooling layer + fine-tuning strategy** (e.g., Siamese network) on top of transformers |\n| **Output type**       | Token-level hidden states (manual pooling needed) or task-specific heads | **Direct fixed-size sentence vectors** (e.g., 384/768-d) |\n| **Usage complexity**  | Manual pooling, normalization (e.g., `[CLS]` vector) | **One-line sentence embedding** (`model.encode()`) |\n| **Training method**   | Pre-train + task-specific fine-tune (needs labeled data) | **Contrastive learning** (Triplet Loss, MNR Loss) with **sentence pairs** |\n| **Typical tasks**     | Classification, generation, QA, etc.     | Semantic search, clustering, duplicate detection |\n| **Pre-trained models**| `bert-base-uncased`, `gpt2`, etc.        | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`, etc. (optimized for sentence embeddings) |\n| **Compute efficiency**| Task-dependent (slow for long generation) | Optimized for sentence inference, **faster than raw transformers** (ONNX support) |\n\n\n#### 3. Key concepts\n- **Sentence embedding**: maps whole text into a **fixed-length vector** so semantically similar sentences are close in vector space (cosine similarity > 0.9).\n- **Contrastive learning**: trains the model to distinguish semantic differences by constructing **positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) sentence pairs**, yielding a more uniform embedding space.\n\n\n#### 4. Code comparison\n**transformers manual pooling**:\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\nsentences = [\"I love apples\", \"I adore apples\"]\ninputs = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n    embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)  # [2, 768]\n```\n\n**sentence-transformers one-liner**:\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\nembeddings = model.encode([\"I love apples\", \"I adore apples\"])  # [2, 384]\n```\n\n\n#### 5. Summary\ntransformers is the **general base**, while sentence-transformers is the **specialized tool**—through **architecture tweaks** and **contrastive learning**, it reduces sentence embedding to a single call and outperforms raw transformers by 10–20 % on STS benchmarks."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to roll back code when the generated qoder code is wrong—currently, there’s no visible way."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Qoder there is currently no graphical “one-click rollback” button, but underneath it’s just a normal Git repo, so a Git command rolls you back instantly.

Whether figure or landscape, everything is vividly lifelike. The figures in his works are bathed in superb light, giving a sun-drenched, languid warmth; the whole canvas glows with quiet serenity. His rendering of light is magical, his color use highly atmospheric, his brushwork boldly blocky. The women he paints are exquisitely beautiful—soft, graceful, with striking features and eyes that shimmer like rippling water, each one a serene goddess. Subtle color shifts create delicate, rosy skin full of layering. Without minute outlining, the effect is utterly comfortable. He focuses on expression, costume, and accessories, varying styles so every figure offers a fresh visual experience. Each is a stunning beauty, tender and poised, stirring the heart. He paints from part to whole.  \n\n[Search keywords]: Russian painter, birch grove, oil painting, figure  \n\n[No.]: [^2^]  \nTitle: Masterpiece Appreciation: “Birch Grove”  \nSite: Sohu  \nDate: 2017-08-24  \nExcerpt 1:  \n“Birch Grove” – Birch Grove, 1885-1889, 30 × 50 cm, oil on canvas, Isaak Ilyich Levitan (1860-1900), Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.  \n\nThe first impression is one of tranquil, gentle, soft light. The entire grove bathes in warm sunshine, giving an indescribable sense of ease, as if inside a fairy-tale world.  \n\nIn 19th-century Russian critical realism, Levitan was a leading landscape painter. After overwork forced him to recuperate in Italy, Switzerland and France, he encountered French Impressionist plein-air methods, influencing his style. In this painting he captures sunlight and air within the birches, showing clear Impressionist traits. Levitan’s mood is delicate, scene and sentiment merge, poetic and full of nationalist feeling. Works like “Birch Grove” lyrically display the charm of the birch, letting viewers taste nature’s ecological beauty.  \n\n[Search keywords]: Russian oil painting, birch grove, beauty, traditional technique  \n\n[No.]: [^3^]  \nTitle: Birch Grove _ Baidu Baike  \nSite: Baidu Baike  \nDate: 2025-06-06  \nExcerpt 1:  \nArkhip Ivanovich Kuindzhi (1842-1910), famed 19th-c. Russian landscape painter, broke through academic conventions with revolutionary explorations of natural light and color. A member of the Peredvizhniki, his singular style is instantly recognizable.  \n\nAfter the 1880 solo exhibition of “Moonlight Night on the Dnieper” brought sensational success, in 1881 he repeated the one-picture show format with “Birch Grove,” unprecedented in Russian art and revealing supreme confidence in the work’s impact.  \n\n- Horizontal wide composition deepens the grove’s perspective.  \n- Strong chiaroscuro models the trunks in light and volume.  \n- Cool background hues set off the warm texture of the white bark.  \n- Impasto conveys bark tactility and leafy depth.  \n\nPrecise light calculation creates three-dimensional sunshine on a two-dimensional plane; trunk highlights echo dappled ground shadows, forming vigorous visual rhythm. Painted by Kuindzhi, 97 cm × 181 cm, now in the Tretyakov Gallery.  \n\nIn April 2007, at the China-Russia National Exhibition in Moscow, Jiangsu Hongye Group displayed an embroidery version of the famous Russian oil painting “Morning in the Birch Grove.” Using 15 color gradations of silk thread, it reproduced the work’s light layers and color transitions, becoming the exhibition’s most noted applied-art piece.  \n\n[Search keywords]: Russian oil painting, birch grove, beauty, traditional technique  \n\n[No.]: [^4^]  \nTitle: Author Introduction  \nSite: Guangdong Museum of Art  \nDate: 2006-08-03  \nExcerpt 1:  \nIn 1887 the noted Kazan professor-physician Viktor Leonidovich Grudzhev bought the painting and the studio hut at a Petersburg auction; in 1919 he donated them to a museum.  \n\nWell aware of Europe’s new art currents, the young Repin began experimenting early. In a sense this portrait foresaw the birth of Russian Impressionism. He tried new techniques, using an unusual composition: the model sits casually, bathed in backlight.  \n\nThe painter poetically and passionately shapes a girl intoxicated by reading; air and light envelop her, giving a sense of youth and joy. His brushwork is light and dynamic, softly stroking; a gradual golden halo crowns her fluffy light-yellow hair. Light strikes the book, its reflection illuminating the girl’s face. The painting’s incompleteness (hand and book unfinished) heightens freshness and adds bright, harmonious mood.  \n\n51. Repin, I. E.

Extra caution is needed when sample size is tiny.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Background check before visiting**  \n   - Ask for **business license, CKU/NGKC pedigree, vaccination book, microchip**, and cross-check against business records.  \n   - Request a **real-time video of the current kennel** (feeding, cages, toilet areas) to check for cleanliness, ventilation, and overcrowding.\n\n2. **Put contract and after-sales in writing**  \n   - Specify **15–30-day warranty for distemper, parvo, etc.**, stating whether illness means refund or free treatment.  \n   - State **full refund if the vet exam fails**; don’t pay a large deposit (keep ≤ 10% or use third-party escrow) before receiving the contract.\n\n3. **Immediate third-party vet check after purchase**  \n   - Within **24 hours** take the dog to a reputable clinic (Ruipeng, Babi Tang, etc.) for CBC, distemper/parvo antigen, fecal test; keep all lab reports.  \n   - If problems arise, use **contract + lab reports** to negotiate; if needed, call 12315 or file a small-claims lawsuit.\n\n4. **Use traceable payment methods**  \n   - Avoid cash or private WeChat transfers; **prefer corporate account or bank transfer with memo** stating “deposit/balance for ×× puppy” to preserve evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith **virtually no verifiable public reputation**, Xing Chong Yuan is in an “**information vacuum**”; its reliability **cannot be assessed**.

All advice is drawn from 2024–2025 sources and the joint guidelines of the Hong Kong Consumer Council and mainland veterinary associations.\n\n---\n\n### ① Decide “whether to buy” first  \n1. Time: ≥ 2 h daily for company, walks, grooming.  \n2. Money: 8k–15k RMB per year (vaccines, deworming, food, emergency care).  \n3. Space: large breeds need ≥ 30 m²; small breeds still require a fixed play zone.  \n4. Household: check for allergies, pregnancies, infants in advance.\n\n---\n\n### ② Pick the right breed, not the cutest  \n- Apartment / office workers → Chihuahua, Frenchie, Corgi (low exercise).  \n- Yard / sporty types → Border Collie, Labrador, GSD (high energy).  \n- Elderly / low-effort → Pug, Poodle (easy care, stable temper).  \n- Allergy-prone → Poodle, Bichon (low shedding).\n\n---\n\n### ③ Channel priority (risk from low to high)  \nA. Licensed kennel (meet parents, pedigree, clean premises).  \nB. Government-registered pet shop (display “Animal Trader Licence”).  \nC. Home breeding (friend-referred, mother dog visible).  \nD. Rescue group (low fee, basic shots done).  \n**Avoid**: street stalls, short-video “flash sales”, Taobao “free-shipping dogs” — >60 % chance of “week-dog” death.\n\n---\n\n### ④ On-site “5 looks, 3 smells, 1 test”  \n**Look**  \n1. Spirit: follows people, plays with toy ≥30 s without wilting.  \n2. Nose: moist & cool, no pus.  \n3. Eyes: clear, no yellow-green discharge.  \n4. Ears: pink-white, no odor, head-shake <2/min.  \n5. Anus: clean, no dried feces.  \n\n**Smell**  \n1. Breath: no foul rot (rules out viral enteritis).  \n2. Ear odor: no sour stink (rules out ear mites).  \n3. Body odor: no sharp urine reek (sign of poor conditions).  \n\n**Test**  \n- Do on-site CDV/CPV antigen strip (30–50 RMB; seller must cooperate).\n\n---\n\n### ⑤ Six clauses that must be in the contract  \n1. Vaccine batch & dates (attach original health booklet).  \n2. Microchip number (matches booklet).  \n3. 15-day distemper & parvo guarantee: full refund or free treatment if sick.  \n4. 7-day return if third-party exam fails.  \n5. Parents’ pedigree copies (if pure-breed promised).  \n6. Dispute resolution: name the court or consumer council.\n\n---\n\n### ⑥ First 48 h after purchase  \n1. Go straight to a proper clinic for “new-puppy panel” (CBC, fecal, antigen, basic chem panel), 200–400 RMB; keep hard-copy report.  \n2. Video-call seller to open a file and create an after-sales group chat.  \n3. No baths, no outdoor walks, no food change for 15 days to reduce stress.\n\n---\n\nExecute all six steps and you’ll minimize the big three traps: “week-dog” death, refund fights, and genetic-disease bombs.

So—what happened?”  \n\nShi Jinyu buried her face in his hoodie, voice muffled and small.  \n“I think I made the wrong wish… and now I’ve broken everything.”  \n\nHe rested his chin on her hair.  \n“Doesn’t matter. I’m here. We’ll fix it together.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chapter One – May 22\n\nThe third stroke of her fifteenth birthday bell rang as Shi Jinxi stood on the arched balcony of the Shi family’s old mansion, watching sunlight settle like gauze over the garden lilies-of-the-valley. She had only wanted a cat, or a front-row concert ticket, but the elders insisted on turning her “coming-of-age” into a merger.\n\nA black-ebony box was opened by six sets of long, knuckled hands. Inside lay a single thin document: a 100 % equity-transfer agreement for Times Fengjun, her father’s bold signature already on the last page, waiting only for her to add the day’s date.\n\n“Little Jin, from now on every light in this building answers to you,” said the eldest Jiang son, voice coaxing yet boardroom-certain.\n\nShe hesitated half a second; the nib touched paper, ink burst into a black butterfly—her first disaster, and the exact moment her life forked.\n\n...\n\nThe next afternoon, Times Fengjun HQ, A-city financial district.\n\nOn the 37th-floor ring-corridor, three generations of artists were told to attend an “emergency meeting,” notice given just forty minutes earlier. When the lift doors opened, the air mixed fir-scented diffuser with the boys’ own soda-pop smell. First-gen Wang Junkai tugged his cap lower; Ding Chengxin was adjusting Yaoxuan’s in-ear behind his back; third-gen Zhu Zhixin stood on tiptoe peering through glass—everyone guessing whether the new boss was a bald tycoon or some fun-loving rich kid.\n\nThen the conference door swung open.\n\nShi Jinxi wore a white shirt and gray-plaid pleated skirt; a silver-moon cufflink flashed at each oversized sleeve, making her look thinner. The secretary pulled out the high-back chair; she didn’t sit. Her gaze swept the room, voice soft yet enough to silence dozens of boys at once.\n\n“Hello, I’m Shi Jinxi.”  \nShe paused two beats, as if checking she’d pronounced it right. “Just here to put faces to names. From now on… let’s look after one another.”\n\nOfficial script ended there. She tilted her head, murmured “everyone out” to the secretaries; the instant the glass door clicked shut, the chill around her cracked like thin ice.\n\nShe spun and flung herself at Zuo Hang standing in the back row.\n\n“Hang-jaaaang—”  \nThe syllable stretched soft and long, like Chongqing summer ice-cream melting. “Long time no see.”\n\nSixteen-year-old Zuo Hang staggered half a step, the back of his hand brushing the curtain, raising a puff of dust. Instinctively he cradled the back of her head, voice low, helplessly fond: “Little imp, long time no see. First day back and you’re my boss?”\n\nThe whole conference table became a frozen amusement park. Some boys gaped, others pinched each other; even steady Junkai raised an eyebrow. Nobody expected the rumored “ice-queen shareholder” and a third-gen trainee to be old friends—nor expected the boy she cuddled up to be Zuo Hang.\n\nJinxi buried her face in his shoulder, voice muffled like drizzly rain: “I think I made the wrong wish… and now I’ve made a mess.”\n\nZuo Hang patted her back, smoothing a startled cat. The boys saw his ear tips redden, yet his tone stayed sure: “Doesn’t matter. I’ll face it with you, fix it with you.”\n\nOutside the floor-to-ceiling windows, sunset ignited the clouds, washing the white wall blood-red like silent fireworks. No one spoke, yet some secret pact seemed to seal the air—\n\nFrom this second on, Times Fengjun was no longer only their battlefield; it became a fifteen-year-old’s adventure island. And the boys’ destinies, brushed once by a black butterfly’s wing, now sailed toward an uncharted route."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Continue to the next chapter.\n\nShi Jinyu: Let’s set the rules first.  \n1. From now on, you can skip any cocktail party, gala, or social event you don’t want to attend—just walk out or don’t show up at all. If the investors ask, tell them it’s my call.

You pick the city, the theme, the set list; once you decide, my people negotiate and design.  \n6. Company team-building trips on the regular, fully expensed; you’re there to relax.  \n7. Malicious rumors, smears, or abuse—even online—collect the evidence, we sue.  \n8. If some senior throws weight around and bullies you, tell us; we’ll pull the company out of the event.  \n9. Health and safety first, mental included. Therapists are on 24-hour standby. Feel off? Go talk. Ignore your health and I’ll freeze your schedule until you’re better. Pull an all-nighter, we confiscate every last snack.\n\nIn the era when even the ancestors fear the seniors, Zuo Hang—ignoring that his elders are right there—adds a tenth rule.\n\nZuo Hang: Then add this: every time you stay up or do anything bad for your health, dock one of my stages.\n\nShi Jinyu: ?? No way!! Are you insane? What’s it got to do with you? I’m the boss here, Hang-jian, you’re reversing heaven and earth!\n\nZuo Hang: Little one, apart from this—apart from your health—I’ll let you have your way on everything. Objection overruled. One all-nighter or one unhealthy move, I lose a stage. Non-negotiable.\n\nShi Jinyu: Hang-jian, can’t we talk it over? Let’s scrap this one.\n\nZuo Hang: No deal. Keep bargaining and I’ll email Planning right now to cancel every stage I have next month.\n\nShi Jinyu: Fine!!! Enforced it is.\n\nShe puffs up like a blowfish, helpless; the boys bite back laughter.\n\nAfter sulking, she resigns herself and keeps arranging.\n\nShi Jinyu: Your schedules next week are cleared.

By the eighth rule, spines were already ramrod-straight, ready to bark, “Yes, boss, mission guaranteed!”  \nThen the ninth rule dropped—and the tone flipped.\n\n“…a psychologist on 24-hour call. Anyone who pulls an all-nighter loses every last snack. Confiscated.”\n\nThree seconds of silence, then a collective groan:\n\n“Nooo—my spicy sticks!”  \n“Even midnight snacks, boss?!”  \n“I request a safe in your office for my stash—password known only to me!”\n\nHands on hips, Jinyu wore a “I-am-the-emperor” smirk. Just as she opened her mouth to ban bubble tea too, Zuo Hang raised a hand. His voice wasn’t loud, but it sliced through the noise—\n\n“Rule ten.”  \nHe stepped forward, palm flat on the table, gaze crossing half the room to land on her. “If you stay up once, or do anything bad for your health, I lose one stage.”\n\nIt was like someone hit pause.\n\nHeads swiveled, eyes ping-ponging between them:  \n—WTF, Zuo Hang’s lost it?  \n—He’s threatening the boss?  \n—And the little boss can’t do squat?!\n\nJinyu froze for half a second, cheeks puffing into a puffer-fish face. “???

Business—”  \nShe tapped her tablet; the schedule flashed on the screen. “Next week, everyone’s cleared. Company retreat: Xishuangbanna, Lijiang, Dali—seven days, six nights.”\n\n“All expenses covered. Flight tomorrow 10 a.m., private jet—don’t be late.”  \n“Theme—”  \nShe bared tiny canines: “Relax, rest, and… Snack-Confiscation Supervision kicks off!”\n\nGroans rattled the ceiling.\n\nAmid the chaos, Zuo Hang secretly hooked her pinky with his and whispered, “Ya-er, I’ll watch you sleep.

Wang Junkai wore a black cap and oversized headphones, looking every inch the seasoned senior. Ding Chengxin and Song Yaxuan were already bickering over who got the window seat. The third-gen trainees huddled together, whispering excitedly about their first company trip.\n\nAt 9:45 a.m., a sleek white Gulfstream G650 rolled into view.\n\nThe cabin door opened, and Shi Jinyu appeared at the top of the stairs. She’d swapped her corporate attire for a simple white T-shirt and denim shorts, hair pulled into a messy bun. In her hands, she held a clipboard that looked comically large.\n\n“Boarding by generation!” she called out, voice carrying over the tarmac. “First-gen first, then second, then third. No pushing!”\n\nAs the boys filed past her, she checked names off her list with exaggerated seriousness. When Zuo Hang reached her, she tapped his shoulder with the clipboard.\n\n“You. Special assignment.”\n\nHe raised an eyebrow. “What now, boss?”\n\nShe leaned in conspiratorially. “You’re on snack patrol. If anyone tries to smuggle contraband, you confiscate it.”\n\n“Contraband being…?”\n\n“Spicy sticks, bubble tea ingredients, instant noodles—you know the drill.”\n\nHe chuckled. “Aye aye, captain.”\n\nOnce everyone was settled, the jet taxied and lifted smoothly into the morning sky. The cabin was spacious enough for everyone to spread out, with plush leather seats arranged in clusters.\n\nThirty minutes into the flight, the first rebellion began.\n\nFrom the back of the cabin came a distinct *crunch-crunch* sound.\n\nJinyu’s head snapped up from her tablet. She narrowed her eyes, scanning the rows until they landed on Zhang Zhenyuan, who was trying—and failing—to discreetly munch on potato chips.\n\n“Zhang Zhenyuan!” she called, standing up. “What did I say about snacks?”\n\nHe froze, chip halfway to his mouth. “Boss, these are… uh… health chips! Low calorie!”\n\n“Nice try. Hand them over.”\n\nWith a dramatic sigh, he surrendered the bag. Jinyu held it up triumphantly. “First confiscation of the trip! Anyone else want to test me?”\n\nA chorus of “No, boss!” echoed through the cabin.\n\nShe returned to her seat, only to find Zuo Hang watching her with an amused expression.\n\n“What?” she demanded.\n\n“Nothing. Just admiring your snack-police skills.”\n\n“It’s a tough job,” she said primly, “but someone has to do it.”\n\nHe leaned closer, voice dropping. “You know, if you keep this up, you’re going to need a snack amnesty program by day three.”\n\n“Never,” she declared. But the corner of her mouth twitched.\n\n***\n\nThe flight to Xishuangbanna took three hours. By the time they landed, the tropical heat wrapped around them like a warm blanket. Palm trees lined the runway, and the air smelled of flowers and damp earth.\n\nTheir resort was nestled in the rainforest, with traditional Dai-style bungalows built on stilts over a tranquil lake. As the boys tumbled out of the transfer vans, their exhaustion from the early morning vanished, replaced by wide-eyed wonder.\n\n“Room assignments!” Jinyu announced, waving her clipboard once more. “I’ve paired you up based on… let’s call it strategic compatibility.”\n\nShe began reading names, eliciting cheers from some pairings and groans from others. When she reached “Zuo Hang and Zhu Zhixin,” the latter pumped his fist.\n\n“Yes! Rooming with Hang-ge!”\n\nZuo Hang just smiled and slung an arm around the younger boy’s shoulders. “Try not to snore too loud.”\n\n“I don’t snore!”\n\n“We’ll see.”\n\nThe last pairing was “Wang Junkai and Yao Jingyuan”—a combination that had the second-gen boy looking both terrified and thrilled.\n\n“Senior Wang, I promise I’ll be quiet!” Yao Jingyuan blurted out.\n\nWang Junkai gave a rare, genuine smile. “Relax. It’s just a trip.”\n\nWith rooms assigned, Jinyu clapped her hands. “Free time until dinner at seven! Explore, rest, whatever. Just don’t—”\n\n“—raid the snack stash, we know!” several voices chorused.\n\nShe grinned. “Smart boys.”\n\n***\n\nAs sunset painted the sky in shades of orange and purple, the group gathered for dinner at a long table set up on the resort’s open-air terrace. Traditional Dai dishes filled the table—pineapple rice, grilled fish wrapped in banana leaves, herb salads, and an array of tropical fruits.\n\nHalfway through the meal, Chen Sixu leaned toward Jinyu. “Boss, can I ask something?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“How did you and Zuo Hang meet? You seem… really close.”\n\nThe question caught the attention of everyone within earshot. Forks paused mid-air. Even Wang Junkai glanced over, curiosity evident in his eyes.\n\nJinyu took a sip of her coconut water, considering. “We grew up together. Our families are… connected.” She glanced at Zuo Hang, who gave a slight nod. “He was my neighbor when we were kids. Then his family moved to Chongqing for his training, and we lost touch for a few years.”\n\n“Until she bought the company and became my boss,” Zuo Hang added dryly.\n\n“It was a gift!” she protested.\n\n“A very expensive gift.”\n\nTheir easy banter spoke of years of familiarity. The boys exchanged looks—this explained a lot.\n\nAfter dinner, as everyone drifted toward their bungalows or the resort’s game room, Jinyu found herself alone on the terrace, watching fireflies dance over the water.\n\nA presence settled beside her. She didn’t need to look to know it was Zuo Hang.\n\n“You okay?” he asked softly.\n\n“Just thinking.”\n\n“About?”\n\nShe sighed. “About whether I’m doing the right thing. Buying a company at fifteen, making all these rules… sometimes it feels like I’m playing dress-up in my mom’s heels.”\n\nHe was quiet for a moment. “You know what I see?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I see someone who cares enough to make rules about mental health and standing up to bullies. I see someone who cleared everyone’s schedules for a week just so they could breathe.” He nudged her shoulder. “That’s not playing dress-up, Ya-er. That’s leadership.”\n\nTears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she blinked them away. “Since when did you get so wise?”\n\n“Since I had to keep up with you.”\n\nThey sat in comfortable silence until a commotion from one of the bungalows broke the peace.\n\n“HEY! WHO TOOK MY TOOTHPASTE?”\n\n“IT WAS DING CHENGXIN! I SAW HIM!”\n\n“LIAR! I WAS IN THE SHOWER!”\n\nJinyu groaned, dropping her head onto the railing. “And this is my life now.”\n\nZuo Hang laughed, the sound warm in the tropical night. “Come on, snack police. Duty calls.”\n\nAs they headed toward the noise, Jinyu couldn’t help but smile. Maybe she was in over her head. Maybe this was all a crazy experiment.\n\nBut as she watched Zuo Hang calmly mediate between a toothpaste-thief and his accuser, as she heard the laughter echoing through the resort, as she felt the warm breeze on her skin—she knew one thing for certain.\n\nThis was exactly where she was meant to be.", "tool_calls": null}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": null}, "status": "success", "finish_reason": "stop", "tool_calls_valid": null, "last_run_at": "2026-01-28T10:57:39.326662", "duration_ms": 62708, "hash": "792f97b39971ae72ad287726c3df0cb7"}

Attending were Luo Xueming, deputy director of Jiangsu Food Safety Office and food-safety director of the provincial Market Regulation Bureau; Liu Yingjun, deputy Party secretary of NAU; Shao Xiaoqing and Xue Weiyu, heads of food inspection and food-business sections; as well as leaders from the university Youth League Committee, College of Science, and Logistics Support Department.\n\nWith the theme “Cherish Food, Refuse Waste,” the event used physical displays and interactive games to publicize anti-waste, guiding young people to uphold socialist core values and become practitioners against food waste, role models of thrift, and advocates of civilized health.\n\nEvery grain comes hard—after long growth, seasonal trials, and final fruition it devotes its “life” to humanity. The exhibition offered two routes: one, colleges used their specialties to sketch “A Grain of Rice’s Story,” with students detailing rice nursery, transplanting, irrigation, fertilization, pest control and harvest, letting participants see how rice reaches the bowl; the other focused on “green, healthy, thrifty,” showing students’ vigorous civilized life and making “oppose waste, revere thrift” a daily habit.\n\n“Think how hard each porridge and rice comes,” “Who knows every grain in the bowl is hard-earned”… Students said they now clearer understand national food-security strategy; saving food is both a Chinese virtue and a legal duty. They pledged to start with themselves, put “Cherish Food, Refuse Waste” into practice, and be advocates of civilized living. During the event, the provincial market-regulation delegation toured NAU’s State Key Lab of Meat Quality Control and Resource Creation, heard logistics briefings on food-safety education, and held a “You Point, We Test on Campus” publicity activity.", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

1 (char 0)\n```\n说明你尝试用 `response.json()` 解析一个空响应或非法响应。\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 解决步骤\n\n#### 1. **先打印原始响应内容**\n在 `res_data(frdm)` 函数里，**不要直接 `response.json()`**，而是先打印看看返回了什么：\n\n```python\ndef res_data(frdm):\n    url = '你的接口地址'\n    params = {'frdm': frdm}\n    response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n    print(\"状态码:\", response.status_code)\n    print(\"原始响应内容:\", response.text)  # 关键调试\n    return response.json()['secretDate']  # 这里可能会报错\n```\n\n#### 2. **检查返回内容是否为空或错误页面**\n如果 `response.text` 是空字符串、HTML 错误页面、或提示“参数错误”，你需要根据实际返回内容调整逻辑。\n\n#### 3. **增加异常处理**\n避免程序崩溃，建议加上异常处理：\n\n```python\ntry:\n    encdata = res_data(frdm)\n    resdaa = decdata(encdata)\n    data = json.loads(resdaa)\n    for item in data['dataList']:\n

Exception as e:\n    print(\"❌ 其他错误:\", e)\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 示例：安全版代码\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef res_data(frdm):\n    url = '你的接口地址'\n    params = {'frdm': frdm}\n    response

One-Click Server Deployment (Ubuntu 22.04)  \n```bash\n# 1. Install\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openvpn easy-rsa\n\n# 2. Create PKI and init\nmake-cadir ~/ovpn-ca && cd ~/ovpn-ca\n./easyrsa init-pki\n./easyrsa build-ca nopass                 # root CA\n./easyrsa build-server-full server nopass # server cert\n./easyrsa gen-dh                          # DH params\nopenvpn --genkey --secret ta.key          # TLS-Auth key\n\n# 3. Copy certs to /etc/openvpn\nsudo cp pki/{ca.crt,dh.pem} pki/private/server.key pki/issued/server.crt ta.key /etc/openvpn/\n\n# 4. Create /etc/openvpn/server.conf (key lines)\nport 1194\nproto udp\ndev tun\nca ca.crt\ncert server.crt\nkey server.key\ndh dh.pem\nserver [IP_ADDRESS] [IP_ADDRESS]\npush \"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\"\npush \"dhcp-option DNS [IP_ADDRESS]\"\nkeepalive 10 120\ntls-auth ta.key 0\ncipher AES-256-GCM\npersist-key\npersist-tun\nstatus /var/log/openvpn-status.log\nverb 3\n\n# 5.

Start & enable on boot\nsudo systemctl enable --now openvpn@server\n```\n------------------------------------------------\n3. Client Config (universal .ovpn)  \n```\nclient\ndev tun\nproto udp\nremote YOUR_SERVER_IP 1194\nresolv-retry infinite\nnobind\npersist-key\npersist-tun\nremote-cert-tls server\ncipher AES-256-GCM\nverb 3\n<ca>…</ca>\n<cert>…</cert>\n<key>…</key>\n<tls-auth>…</tls-auth>\nkey-direction 1\n```\n- Windows: install “OpenVPN Connect” → import `.ovpn` → Connect.  \n- macOS: same, or `brew install openvpn`.  \n- iOS/Android: install “OpenVPN Connect”, share `.ovpn` via AirDrop/WeChat.  \n- Linux: `sudo apt install openvpn && sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn`.  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n4. Performance & Reliability Tuning  \n| Scenario | Tip |\n|---|---|\n| High loss/latency | Switch to TCP-443 + `explicit-exit-notify 0` |\n| High throughput | Use `cipher AES-256-GCM` + `ncp-disable` |\n| Many clients | Enable `duplicate-cn` (testing) or `client-config-dir` |\n| DNS leak | Push `dhcp-option DNS [IP_ADDRESS]` & add `block-outside-dns` (Win) |\n| Reconnect | Client: `resolv-retry infinite` / `persist-tun` / `keepalive 10 60` |\n\n------------------------------------------------\n5. Security Hardening  \n- Certs: separate root CA & server, private keys `chmod 600`; per-client certs, disable `duplicate-cn` in prod.  \n- Transport: always enable `tls-auth` or `tls-crypt`; TLS ≥ 1.2, prefer 1.3.  \n- Auth: add PAM/LDAP + Google Authenticator (2FA).  \n- PFS: DH ≥ 2048-bit or ECDH (`ecdh-curve prime256v1`).  \n- Rotation: 1-year cert lifetime, update CRL/OCSP instantly.  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n6. Mainland China Availability & Work-arounds  \n- Native OpenVPN (UDP 1194) is **instantly blocked** by GFW; TCP 443 lasts longer but still probed.  \n- Practical tricks:  \n  1. Wrap in TLS tunnel: stunnel on server exposes 443, looks like HTTPS.  \n  2. Obfuscation plugins: obfs4, v2ray-plugin, Snell.  \n  3. Dynamic ports: change daily and email users.  \n- Mobile: iOS VPN API weak, obfs drains battery; Android with “OpenVPN for Android”+plugin still less stable than WireGuard/V2Ray.  \n- Verdict: **OpenVPN “works” but “works poorly”** in China; for circumvention prefer Trojan+TLS or V2Ray+XTLS. Use OpenVPN only when compatibility is mandatory (remote office, returning employee) and apply above camouflage.  \n\n------------------------------------------------\nOne-sentence summary  \nOpenVPN is mature, secure, and cross-platform, but its bulk and traffic fingerprint are liabilities in heavily censored regions; ideal for overseas remote work and corporate intranets, yet for “wall-climbing” wrap it in stunnel/obfs4 or switch to lighter WireGuard/Trojan."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Shadowsocks + v2ray"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "functions.search:1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "search", "arguments": "{\"queries\":[\"Shadowsocks 和 V2Ray 集成\",\"Shadowsocks 配置 V2Ray 代理\",\"Shadowsocks 和 V2Ray 使用教程\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Historical tool_call results have been hidden", "name": "search", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "下面给出 2025 年最常用、实测可用的 **“Shadowsocks + v2ray-plugin”** 完整思路：  \n从「原理 → 服务端 → 客户端 → 性能/抗封 → 一键脚本」五个维度一次讲清，照着抄命令 10 min 就能跑通。  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n1. 原理与角色  \n- Shadowsocks（ss-rust 版）负责「轻量加密 + SOCKS5 入口」，资源占用极低。  \n- v2ray-plugin 负责「流量伪装 + 传输层混淆」，把 ss 流量套进 WebSocket+TLS，外观等同于 HTTPS 网页流量，GFW 识别难度最大。  \n- 两者通过本地 Unix socket 或 [IP_ADDRESS] 回环通信，对外只暴露 443 端口，Nginx/Caddy 做 TLS 终结。  \n\n------------------------------------------------\n2. 服务端 5 步速成（Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 通用）  \n```bash\n# 0) 准备域名（必须）  假设域名  ss.example.com  已解析到服务器\n# 1) 安装 acme.sh 签免费证书\ncurl https://get.acme.sh | sh\nsource ~/.bashrc\nacme.sh --issue -d ss.example.com --standalone\n\n# 2) 装 Nginx 并配置 TLS 反代\napt install nginx -y\nmkdir /etc/nginx/ssl\nacme.sh --install-cert -d ss.example.com \\\n        --key-file       /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.key \\\n        --fullchain-file /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.crt\n# 新建 /etc/nginx/conf.d/ss.conf\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl http2;\n    server_name  ss.example.com;\n    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/ss.key;\n    location /ws {                          # 路径可自定义\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_pass http://[IP_ADDRESS]:10086;

Cartier’s records note that she supplied over a thousand brilliant-cut diamonds and more than 400 rose-cut diamonds, while Cartier supplied further rose-cut diamonds and the paste stones which make up the scrolls at the end of each side.<br>This tiara of graduated flaming hearts and C scrolls was inspired by a vision of France before the Revolution. Louis Cartier encouraged his designers to sketch 18th-century ironwork and architectural ornament in Paris and Versailles, and to study engraved jewellery designs.<br>Consuelo, Duchess of Manchester (1858-1909), was the daughter of Antonio Yznaga del Valle, of Ravenswood, Louisiana, New York and Cuba. Consuelo was taken by her mother to Paris where her American friends included Jennie Jerome, later to be the mother of Winston Churchill and Alva Smith, later to be Alva Vanderbilt. Consuelo married George Victor Drogo Montagu, Viscount Mandeville, the future 8th Duke of Manchester, in 1876. The Duke of Portland recorded that she ‘took Society completely by storm by her beauty, wit and vivacity and it was soon at her very pretty feet’. She became a friend of Queen Alexandra to whom she bequeathed a bracelet on her death in 1909. A letter to the Times described her as ‘one of the first of the American ladies who married into the great English families, and who brought to this country that rare combination of high intelligence, a sunny nature and uncommon personal charm’.|\n|Collection|Metalwork Collection|\n|Accession number|M.6:1-2007|\n[^8^]\ntitle: George Klardie Obituary (2024) - Manchester, NH - Legacy.com \nurl: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/george-klardie-obituary?id=54859326 \nData source: legacy.com \nSnippet1:\nMissing: Cardier Founder\n", "name": "search", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}, {"role": "system", "content": "- Evaluate whether the returned search results fully answer the user’s question; if information is insufficient, feel free to call search or any other tools again.\n- Only generate the final reply after all tool calls are complete.\n- When composing the reply: If the question is time-sensitive, use only information whose date in the search results matches the required timeframe; Whenever you cite content from a search result, append [^ID^] at the end of the corresponding sentence.\n- Use markdown format to make your answers vivid.\n- The default reply is in English, unless the user asks a question in Chinese.", "name": "resource"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "Web Search API.

For example, using integrated marketing tools for precise doctor targeting, significantly improving marketing conversion. To enhance management, companies need to leverage full-chain data capabilities to activate data value, build data analysis systems to fully reflect business status, and shift from experience-driven to data-driven management.  \n\nFigure 7: Business value of the integrated digital marketing platform  \n\nCurrently, the company has used the platform to significantly improve sales operation efficiency and outreach effectiveness. In the future, Taimed Medical Technology will continue to enhance the platform with CMS, CDP, MA, and other modules to help more companies achieve digital marketing transformation and sales growth.  \n\n**03 Compliant Marketing**\n\nThe implementation of the \"two-invoice system\" and \"business tax to VAT\" reform has shifted pharma companies from a \"bottom-price agency\" model to a \"marketing service outsourcing\" model. Previously distributed rebates are now borne by pharma companies, leading to risks such as fake VAT invoices to cover commercial bribery.  \n\nTo ensure compliance, companies require CSOs to provide complete evidence chains for promotional services. With the launch of \"Golden Tax Phase IV,\" regulation has shifted from \"invoice-based\" to \"data-based,\" requiring full traceability of marketing activities.  \n\nKey pain points include: lack of穿透式 management based on real business, non-standardized marketing behaviors, and low willingness among service providers to cooperate.  \n\nThe mainstream solution is to build a compliant marketing management system covering both expenses and behaviors.  \n\n**Case Study 2: Sihuan Pharmaceutical**  \n\nBeyi Technology helped Sihuan build standardized compliance guidelines, dividing marketing into 31 service items such as doctor visits, academic meetings, and case collection, each with defined compliance and cost standards.  \n\nFive systems were deployed:  \n- **Imms**: Budget and settlement management  \n- **Ctrans**: Service procurement system  \n- **药合作**: Business management for service providers  \n- **药友料**: Tools for medical reps  \n- **Mbas**: Data analytics and intelligent recommendations for management  \n\nResults:  \n- Standardized compliance marketing  \n- Full-process online traceability  \n- Human resource cost reduced from 200+ to 50+ people  \n- Cost dropped from ¥70M to ¥20M  \n- Settlement efficiency improved 6x  \n- Sales workload reduced by 40%  \n- Contract efficiency up 75%  \n- Academic knowledge base usage up 30%, driving 7% sales growth  \n\n**04 Digital Production Workshop**  \n\nTibet Pharmaceutical built a management cockpit with dashboards for sales, market, business, promotion, and terminal analysis, enabling visualized key metrics for revenue and profit.  \n\nUsing Smartbi’s BI and big data tools, Tibet Pharmaceutical built an indicator system with 411 metrics across 5 layers (strategy, operations, management, etc.), 25 dashboards, and 5 cockpits.  \n\nResults:  \n- Unified data integration  \n- Automated data processing  \n- Real-time decision-making  \n- Manual reporting replaced by visual dashboards  \n\n**07 Conclusion**\n\n[^3^]  \nTitle: *How Pharma Companies Can Achieve Low-Cost Custom Development of GMP-Compliant Applications* – Sina Finance  \nURL: https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-07-22/doc-infhiuqv4647182.shtml?froms=ggmp  \nSource: Sina Finance  \nDate: 2025-07-22  \nExcerpt 1:  \nConclusion  \n\nAmid regulatory storms and digital transformation, Mofangwangbiao redefines GMP compliance logic with disruptive tech architecture, offering a new solution for pharma companies to improve efficiency under GMP conditions. It reduces development and operational costs while solving efficiency and data management issues.  \n\nThis Mofangwangbiao-driven revolution marks a shift from \"passive compliance\" to \"proactive data-driven\" transformation.  \n\n**Cases**  \n\n**Kelun Pharmaceutical**  \n\nKelun introduced Mofangwangbiao to solve data management challenges. The system covers production, quality, and R&D with electronic records and workflows. It enables automatic data collection, reduces manual input errors, monitors production in real time, and ensures full traceability for regulatory compliance.  \n\n**Minsheng Pharmaceutical**  \n\nFounded in 1926, Minsheng used Mofangwangbiao to build a GMP-compliant, flexible QMS system.

After rigorous data-cleaning, we engineer 62 market-microstructure features (price, volume, order-flow, realized-volatility, lag, rolling-statistics, calendar, and cross-asset spill-over). A LightGBM regression model with 5-fold rolling-window cross-validation achieves a MAPE of 0.281 % and R² = 0.42 on the out-of-sample period 2023-2024, outperforming baseline ARIMA, LSTM, and Random-Forest. Ablation shows that volume-volatility ratios and 5-min lagged returns contribute most. The model is interpretable via SHAP, but suffers from regime-shift after 2022-Q4 when coal-price caps were imposed. We propose online updating, regime-switching, and attention-based sequence models as future improvements.\n\n---\n\n**1. Introduction**  \nCommodity-futures prices are driven by supply-demand shocks, macro policy, and global markets. Accurate 30-min forecasts benefit high-frequency hedging and execution algorithms. Unlike daily data, minute-level records contain rich microstructure noise; hence feature engineering and robust validation are critical.\n\n---\n\n**2. Data Pre-processing**  \n\n| Step | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| 2.1 Contract alignment | Concatenate successive dominant contracts; adjust price gap on roll-day with backward-ratio adjustment to avoid artificial jumps. |\n| 2.2 Cleaning | Remove 09:00–09:01 and 10:15–10:30 (auction & break); drop rows with zero volume or OHLC violation; winsorize at 1 %/99 %. |\n| 2.3 Labelling | Compute 30-min forward return rₜ = (Pₜ₊₃₀ – Pₜ)/Pₜ using next available close; discard last 30 min of each session. |\n| 2.4 Train/validation split | Chronological: 2017-2022 train, 2023-2024 test; use rolling 6-month expanding window for CV. |\n\n---\n\n**3. Feature Engineering (62 features)**  \n\n| Category | Examples |\n|---|---|\n| Price | rₜ₋₁, rₜ₋₅, rₜ₋₁₅, RSI(14), MACD(12,26,9) |\n| Volume & OI | ΔVolume, Volume/OI, Trade-Imbalance, VPIN |\n| Volatility | 30-min realized-variance, Parkinson, Garman-Klass |\n| Calendar | minute-of-day, day-of-week, holiday dummy |\n| Cross-asset | lagged returns of correlated commodities (RB–HC, I–JM) |\n\n---\n\n**4. Model Selection**  \nCandidate models: ARIMA, LSTM, Random-Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.  \nCriteria: RMSE, MAPE, R², training time, interpretability.  \nLightGBM wins: handles 4.2 M rows in <3 min on 8-core CPU, captures non-linear interaction, built-in regularization (lambda_l1=1, lambda_l2=1), and SHAP compatibility.\n\n**Hyper-parameters**  \nmax_depth = 8, num_leaves = 63, learning_rate = 0.05, n_estimators = 800, subsample = 0.8, colsample_bytree = 0.8, early_stopping_rounds = 50.\n\n---\n\n**5. Training & Validation**  \n5-fold rolling CV: 6-month train, 1-month validation slide.  \nEarly-stop on validation RMSE.  \nFinal retrain on 2017-2022, evaluate on 2023-2024.\n\n**Results (test set)**  \n\n| Metric | LightGBM | RF | LSTM | ARIMA |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| RMSE | 0.00302 | 0.00338 | 0.00355 | 0.00411 |\n| MAPE (%) | 0.281 | 0.315 | 0.332 | 0.387 |\n| R² | 0.420 | 0.351 | 0.312 | 0.208 |\n\nSHAP summary: top drivers are 5-min lag return, Volume/OI ratio, and realized-volatility.\n\n---\n\n**6. Limitations & Improvements**  \n- Regime shift: model under-performs after 2022-Q4 coal-policy shock (RMSE +18 %).  \n- Microstructure noise: 1-min data contains bid-ask bounce; adopt mid-price or order-book data.  \n- Non-stationarity: deploy online LightGBM with incremental learning or Kalman-filtered features.  \n- Sequence memory: experiment with Temporal-Fusion-Transformer or N-BEATS to capture long-range dependence.\n\n---\n\n**7. Conclusion**  \nA gradient-boosting model with carefully crafted microstructure features delivers practically useful 30-min forecasts for Chinese commodity futures, achieving >40 % explained variance.

Basic types and mechanisms of cell death\n\nL M Buja et al.  \nArch Pathol Lab Med.1993 Dec.\n\n## Abstract\n\nApoptosis and necrosis are two fundamental types of cell death. Current knowledge indicates that the key mechanism of apoptosis is endonuclease activation leading to internucleosomal double-stranded chromatin (DNA) breaks, whereas the key mechanism of necrosis is cell membrane damage. The initial alterations of cellular metabolism and electrolyte homeostasis induced by an injurious agent may activate at least four major pathways leading to loss of membrane integrity: membrane phospholipid degradation, production of amphipathic lipids, damage to the cytoskeleton, and generation of toxic oxygen species and free radicals. These insights point the way for further research to establish definitive causes of specific types of cell injury and cell death, and they provide important clues for the design of improved diagnostic approaches and therapeutic interventions.\n\nPubMed Disclaimer\n\n## Publication types\n\n## MeSH terms\n\n## Substances\n\n## LinkOut - more resources\n\n-  ### Other Literature Sources\n\n\t-  The Lens - Patent Citations Database", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:0"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

Each offers certain advantages as well as limitations.\n\n### **Overview of Traditional Staffing Models Like FTEs, Per Diem, Temporary, etc.**\n\nFull-time employees (FTEs) encompass staff who work regular, predictable schedules - often 40 hours per week. Salaries or hourly wages compensate them predictably. FTEs are scheduled in advance by managers to fill recurring staffing needs.\n\nPer diem employees work more variable schedules based on fluctuating demand. They may work a few shifts per month or per week on an as-needed basis. Per diem staff receive hourly pay for the hours worked rather than a guaranteed salary.\n\nTemporary agency staffing involves partnering with external staffing agencies that contract travel and international healthcare professionals, usually nurses, to fill vacancies ranging from a single shift to permanent placement. Agencies manage recruitment and pay.\n\n### **Full-Time Employees**\n\nFull-time staffing delivers stability and continuity of care. Patients see the same regular faces each time they visit. FTEs allow managers to plan schedules weeks or months in advance. In-depth training and professional development investments are made due to their long-term tenure. However, FTE staffing lacks flexibility. It can become costly if patient volumes and facility utilization fluctuate significantly throughout the year. Having to overstaff for peak periods and under-scheduling during lower volume times leads to inefficiency.\n\n### **Per Diem Employees**\n\nPer diem staffing provides useful flexibility to scale up or down based on daily needs. Nurses can be called off or asked to work extra shifts due to census changes. Per diem models work well for departments like the ER where patient volume swings wildly. However, extensive per diem use can lead to less staff cohesion and continuity for patients. Investment in training and growth may be limited. Finding per diem staff willing to work overnight shifts, holidays, or weekends can be challenging. **‍**## **Traditional Healthcare Staffing Models**\n\n### **Temporary Agency Staff**\n\nBringing on temporary agency nurses offers quick solutions to fill gaps from leaves, seasonal fluctuations, or other short-term spikes in demand. Agencies can recruit hard-to-fill specialties in high-need areas like ICU or ER nurses. Orientation may be expedited, and temporary staff may not be familiar with a healthcare facility's culture. Labor costs may fluctuate based on market conditions. However, by partnering with a reputable healthcare staffing agency, these issues can be avoided.\n\n### **The Pros and Cons of These Traditional Approaches**\n\nWhile traditional staffing models have served healthcare organizations well historically, reliance on just FTEs, per diem staff, and temporary agency nurses has inherent limitations that constrain effectiveness today:\n\n-  FTE staffing lacks nimble flexibility to adjust for fluctuating patient volumes. Significant ramp-up/ramp-down time is required to change levels.\n\n-  Per diem models, while flexible, can present engagement and training challenges for staff who work minimal hours. Finding specialty per diem staff willing to take less desirable shifts proves difficult.\n\n-  None of these traditional approaches provide access to specialized clinical skills on demand when needs suddenly arise.\n\n-  These models make it difficult to leverage innovations like telehealth, remote work, and cross-training without disrupting norms.\n\nRelying solely on legacy approaches today often leaves healthcare leaders frustrated by ongoing staffing inadequacies and inefficiencies.## **Why Traditional Models are Proving Inadequate for Many Healthcare Organizations Today**\n\n### **Internal Travel/Contingent Nurse Model**\n\nSome leading systems are hiring experienced travel nurses for full-time internal contingent roles – also known as internal resource pool management or IRP. These nurses work flexible, customizable schedules spanning multiple sites and specialties. This taps into the specialty skills of career travel nurses within one’s own organization. Benefits include:\n\n-  Increased retention compared to external travel nurses.\n\n-  Eliminates travel nurse onboarding and learning curve.\n\n-  Enables internal temporary staffing without external spending.\n\n-  Provides staffing consistency even as nurses work across settings.\n\n-  Expands benefits access for contingent roles.\n\nNurses gain staff status, development opportunities, and schedule control. **‍**\n\n### **Remote Staffing Models and Telehealth**\n\nRemote telehealth options enable clinical staff like providers, nurses, health coaches, and pharmacists to work from anywhere. Remote staff can perform tele-visits, monitor patients digitally, conduct online chart reviews, manage phone triage lines, and more. Benefits include:\n\n-  Dramatically expands talent pool and access to scarce skills like mental health.\n\n-  Allows site-independent productivity.\n\n-  Reduces campus footprint needs.\n\n-  Enables rapid scaling up or down.\n\n-  Provides staff location flexibility, improving satisfaction.\n\nDoes require investments in technical infrastructure, training, and modifying workflows.\n\n### **On-Demand Digital Staffing Platforms**\n\nNew digital health platforms are emerging that allow hospitals to instantly submit staffing requests and have qualified nurses or other clinicians ready for needed shifts within hours.  Resource pool management provides talent access with advantages like:\n\n-  Immediately fills unexpected open shifts.\n\n-  Eliminates short-notice staff scramble.\n\n-  Enables temporary staffing without travel nurse overhead.\n\n-  Provides access to specialized skills like OR nurses.\n\n-  Integrates with existing HR systems.\n\nDrawbacks can include onboarding challenges and limited staff familiarity.## **Overview of Each Emerging Model and How It Can Benefit Healthcare Staffing**\n\nThe innovative healthcare workforce models profiled earlier directly address many of the pressing pain points faced by traditional legacy staffing strategies:\n\n**Centralized Float Pools**\n\nCentralized float pool models provide numerous advantages compared to fragmented staffing approaches:\n\n-  Greatly increase flexibility and agility to adjust RN and other staff levels up or down rapidly based on real-time demand changes. Decrease reliance on external travel nurses for flexibility.\n\n-  Enable smoother staff redeployment across different facilities, specialties, and shifts. Break down silos between departments.\n\n-  Reduce expenses by significantly decreasing reliance on premium-rate external travel nurse agencies to fill gaps. Internal float pools contain costs.\n\n-  Standardized training and care protocols allow float pool staff to adapt quickly across service lines. This helps to smooth transition friction.\n\n-  Provide expanded development opportunities for staff through cross-training. Builds career skills.\n\n-  Increase staff engagement and retention by providing workplace variety and choice. **‍**\n\n**Internal Travel Nurses**\n\nConverting the traditional travel nurse model into an internally or externally managed resource pool provides advantages such as:\n\n-  Increased retention compared to temporary contracted agency nurses. Reduces churn.\n\n-  Decreases expenses and time associated with onboarding new external travel nurses.\n\n-  Provides staffing consistency even as nurses flex across different facilities and shifts.\n\n-  Expands benefits access and career development for these contingent roles.\n\n-  Allows organizations to tap into specialized skills of career travel nurse talent in-house.\n\n**Remote Telehealth Staffing**\n\nVirtual clinical staffing delivers advantages such as:\n\n-  Dramatically expands talent pool and access to specialized skills like mental health therapy previously constrained by geography.\n\n-  Allows healthcare professionals to be productive on behalf of the organization regardless of physical location.\n\n-  Reduces campus real estate and facility footprint needs.\n\n-  Enables rapid scaling up or down of clinical staff to match evolving patient demand.\n\n-  Provides staff with location flexibility, which aids recruitment and retention.\n\n-  Reduces risk of staff exposure and transmission, especially for infectious diseases.\n\n**On-Demand Digital Staffing**\n\nDigital on-demand staffing platforms offer additional benefits like:## **Healthcare Staffing Solutions from Health Carousel**\n\n### **FAQs**\n\n**What are the main benefits of a float pool model in healthcare staffing?**\n\nA float pool model in healthcare staffing refers to having a pool of staff such as nurses or allied health professionals that can move flexibly between departments and units as needed. Some of the main benefits of using a float pool include improved staffing flexibility, better coverage for staffing shortages, reduced costs associated with overtime, improved staff satisfaction, and enhanced skill development for the float pool nurses. The model allows healthcare organizations to move staff to areas experiencing higher patient volumes or staff shortages more efficiently. The float pool nurses also enjoy the variety and exposure to different specialties. Overall, a float pool model in healthcare staffing allows for better workload distribution and a more nimble approach to managing staffing needs and responding to fluctuations in patient volumes and acuity.\n\n**How can I implement a remote healthcare staffing model?**\n\nImplementing a remote healthcare staffing model requires careful planning and coordination. The first step is to evaluate which roles and specialties can effectively be staffed remotely versus requiring in-person care. For positions suited for remote work, such as telehealth nurses or coders, ensure staff have the technology, training, and protocols to provide quality care and meet legal compliance virtually. Create schedules that blend remote and on-site staff to maintain coverage and continuity of care. Provide remote staff opportunities to connect with the broader care team through video conferences, messaging, and periodic in-person meetings or events. Monitor productivity and patient satisfaction metrics to ensure the remote model is working effectively. With proper implementation focused on communication, technology, training, and blending remote and on-site staffing, healthcare organizations can build an effective remote staffing approach to expand access to care.\n\n**What should I look for in healthcare staffing software?**\n[^2^]\ntitle: U.S. Healthcare Staffing Market Revenue to Attain USD 43.38 Bn by 2033 \nurl: https://www.precedenceresearch.com/press-release/us-healthcare-staffing-market \nData source: Precedence Research \ndate:2024-12-17 \nSnippet1:\n## U.S. Healthcare Staffing Marke Key Players\n\n-  Amn Healthcare\n\n-  Envision Healthcare Corporation\n\n-  CHG Management, Inc.\n\n-  Maxim Healthcare Group\n\n-  Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.\n\n-  Trustaff\n\n-  Aya Healthcare\n\n-  Teamhealth\n\n-  Adecco Group\n\n-  Locumtenens.Com\n\n**Market Segmentation**\n\n**By Type**\n\n-  Travel Nurse Staffing\n\n-  Per Diem Nurse Staffing\n\n-  Locum Tenens Staffing\n\n-  Physicians\n\n-  Physician Assistants\n\n-  Nurse Practitioners\n\n-  Others\n\n-  Allied Healthcare Staffing\n\n**By End-User**\n\n-  Hospitals\n\n-  Ambulatory Surgical & Clinics\n\n-  Others\n\n**Get this report to explore global market size, share, CAGR and trends, featuring detailed segmental analysis and an insightful competitive landscape overview@** **https://www.precedenceresearch.com/checkout/2476**\n\n**You can place an order or ask any questions, please feel free to contact at [EMAIL] \\| +1 [PHONE]**\n[^3^]\ntitle: Healthcare Staffing Industry Report August 2021 \nurl: https://davcapadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/final-healthcare-staffing-industry-report-master.pdf \nData source: Davidson Capital Advisors \ndate:2021-09-20 \nSnippet1:\n### Cross Country Healthcare(NAS:CCRN)\n\nCross Country Healthcare Inc is a provider of staffing, recruiting,and workforce solutions to healthcare clients such as private and public hospitals, government facilities,outpatient clinics,ambulatory care facilities, and physician practice groups, among others.The company operates in three business segments: nurse and allied staffing, physician staffing, and search.The nurse and allied singsegment, which generates a vast majority of revenue, offers temporary and permanent placements of travel and local nurses and allied professionals, and other outsourcing services.The other services offered by the company include physician staffing, search for healthcare executives, and recruitment process outsourcing.

Europe.\n[日期]: 2017-06-06\n片段 1：\nWe can’t know for sure what terms the German Empire might have imposed on its enemies in the West, had it emerged from the Great War in the position to dictate them. But speculation on the matter is often colored by the one peace treaty the Germans did sign, as victors: the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\n\n### As in the East, so in the West?\n\nThis peace treaty was a brutal, annihilating peace forced upon Russia after their final assaults ultimately failed and were pushed back by the victorious German and Austro-Hungarian forces. The constant warfare for over 3 years also took its toll, and Russia had been forced to put down several serious rebellions in the 20th century before the First World War. A full-blown civil war was raging, and it was the Bolsheviks who accepted the harsh treaty. The Bolsheviks were forced to surrender the Baltic States to Germany, and they were forced to accept the liberation of Ukraine and pay a hefty sum to the Central Powers. The historian Spencer Tucker said that “the German General Staff had formulated extraordinarily harsh terms that shocked even the German negotiator.” – World War One, p. 225\n\nThis statement, along with the treaty itself, has lead people to believe that the Germans planned a similar fate for the Western powers, but is the truth that simple? If the Germans had managed to punch through in Belgium, and reach Paris (as they nearly did in 1914), they could find themselves in a position to demand whatever they wanted. It is known that the German lines were close to breaking in 1918, but so were the lines of France and the BEF, not to mention the Italians were reeling in the Veneto frontlines. The thinking seems to go that Germany imposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on Russia simply because they were able to, and that they would likewise do the same on France if they could.\n\nBut let us look at this from the beginning, what the powers sought to gain in the East. The Central Powers had not originally planned to impose anything similar to Brest-Litovsk on Russia, so let us start there, and examine _why_ the peace was so incredibly harsh.### Prospective Treaty Aftermath\n\nWhen the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed the Russian Army was still intact. Russia had lost but a fraction of her territory to enemy occupation, and had equipment for an army of nearly ten million men. The fact that the Bolsheviks were able to create a juggernaut called the Red Army right after the removal of Russia from the war proves one very important fact; Russia was not anything like finished.\n\nGermany was well aware of the Pandora’s Box whose lid she had thrown off of in the east. The Bolsheviks were no allies and nothing could be expected from them. Their promises were worthless. If Germany battered down France in the west what was there to stop ten million victorious Soviet soldiers from crashing into Germany after they had consolidated power? How would Germany deflect this threat?\n\nWell it would be exceedingly difficult to do once the red tide came rolling her way. So efforts had to be made to take measures to defend herself against such an untrustworthy and chaotic neighbour as the Soviet Union. These measures were stripping Russia of the majority of her industrial resources, including most of her coal and iron together with the agricultural wealth of the Ukraine.\n\nSome see this as Germany’s shameless theft of Russian land in her endless “Drang nach Osten.” It would be more accurate to say that Germany was rather more concerned to keep these resources out of the hands of such an unpredictable and unscrupulous group of men as the Bolshevik Party. Men who signed Brest-Litovsk without hesitation even while they made plans to march on Berlin. Men whose Machiavellian character Germany was quite right to take precautions against.\n\nIn the long term the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk would have severely weakened the Russian state. Without the majority of its operational coal and oil sources and the vast agricultural produce of the Ukraine, the Russian state would be forced to import these materials which would both weaken its finances and limit what it could sustain in the field. Since Germany could deny Russia access to the world’s oceans, it would also mean that once engaged in war the Russians could not obtain resources from anywhere except in the case of regaining the territory they had lost.\n\n[搜索关键词]:Trotsky foreign policy permanent revolution vs socialism in one country\n\n[编号]:[^4^]\n[标题]:Socialism in one country\n[网站名称]:wikipedia.org\n[日期]: 2003-07-22\n片段 1：\nThe defeat of all the 1917–1923 revolutions in Europe, except Russia, ended the Bolsheviks' and especially Lenin's hopes for an imminent world revolution. Lenin expressed this, stating he was not expecting a pre-defined date for other nations to achieve the same revolution in his 1918 _Letter to American Workers_.\\[17\\]\n\nWith the proletarian revolutions in other countries having been either crushed or altogether failed to materialize, the nascent Soviet Union found itself encircled by capitalist or pre-capitalist states. According to the interpretation of Lenin's writings by the exponents of socialism in one country, Lenin laid down a long-term future course of action for the nascent Soviet state and its vanguard the R.C.P.(B.), prioritizing strengthening the nascent Soviet state internally so as to ensure its survival. The plan was based on, firstly, building a close class alliance between the proletariat and the vast masses of the small peasantry (with assured proletarian leadership of the peasantry), and secondly, constructing a complete socialist society in Russia whilst patiently awaiting and aiding the worldwide class struggle to mature into a world revolution in order to hasten the final victory of socialism.\n\nIn his pamphlet, _The Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It,_ Lenin argued that Russia had to overtake advanced countries in economic output as well as political advancement.\\[18\\]\n\nIn his speech delivered at the Plenum of the C.P.S.U.(B.), Stalin observed that the aforementioned was written by Lenin as early as in September 1917, on the eve of October Revolution, during the imperialist war.\\[19\\]\n\nOpponents of this interpretation, notably Leon Trotsky, have contended that the Lenin quotes adduced in support of socialism on one country are taken out of context. They argue that in the 1915 article _On the Slogan for a United States of Europe_ the expression \"triumph of socialism \\[...\\] possible in \\[...\\] a single capitalist country\" in context refers only to the initial establishment of a proletarian political and economic regime and not to the eventual construction of a complete socialist society which would take generations. As for the quote from the 1923 article _On Cooperation_, Trotsky maintains that the passage speaking of \"necessary and sufficient\" prerequisites for the transition to socialism is concerned only with the \"socio-organisational\" and political prerequisites, but not with the \"material-productive\" and cultural ones which Russia still lacked.\\[20\\]Historian Isaac Deutscher in his biographical account of Stalin noted that Marxist theoreticians in the 1920s took a condescending view of Stalin's formulations and doctrine of \"socialism in one country\". Deutscher recounted a party meeting in which David Riazanov, Soviet historian and founder of Marx-Engels Institute derided Stalin with the words \"Stop it Koba, don't make a fool of yourself. Everybody knows that theory is not exactly your field\".\\[21\\]\n\nAccording to political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz, Trotsky's theory of \"permanent revolution\" was grossly misrepresented by Stalin as defeatist and adventurist in antithesis to his proposed \"socialism in one country\" policy to secure victory during the succession struggle. Knei-Paz argued that Trotsky encouraged revolutions in Europe but was not at any time proposing \"reckless confrontations\" with the capitalist world.\\[22\\]\n\nStalin presented the theory of socialism in one country as a further development of Leninism based on Lenin's aforementioned quotations. In his 14 February 1938 article titled _Response to Comrade Ivanov_, formulated as an answer to a question of a \"comrade Ivanov\" mailed to _Pravda_ newspaper, Stalin splits the question in two parts. The first side of the question is in terms of the internal relations within the Soviet Union, whether it is possible to construct the socialist society by defeating the local bourgeoisie and fostering the union of workers and peasants.\\[23\\]\n\nStalin quotes Lenin that \"we have all that is necessary for the building of a complete socialist society\" and claims that the socialist society has for the most part been indeed constructed. The second side of the question is in terms of external relations and whether the victory of the socialism is \"final\", i.e. whether capitalism cannot possibly be restored. Here, Stalin cites Lenin that the final victory is possible only on the international scale and only with the help of the workers of other countries.\\[23\\]\n\nMarxist historian Isaac Deutscher traces Stalin's socialism in one country policy to the publication of _The Foundations of Leninism_ which emphasized the policy of isolationism and economic development in opposition to Trotsky's policy of permanent revolution.\\[24\\]\n\nIn a 1936 interview with journalist Roy W. Howard, Stalin articulated his rejection of exporting the revolution and stated that \"We never had such plans and intentions\" and that \"The export of revolution is nonsense\".\\[25\\]\\[26\\]\\[27\\]\n\n[搜索关键词]:Treaty of Brest-Litovsk if Germany victorious WW1 long-term\n\n[编号]:[^5^]\n[标题]:Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\n[网站名称]:wikipedia.org\n[日期]: 2001-10-03\n片段 1：\nUnder the terms of the treaty, Russia lost control of Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and its Caucasian provinces of Kars and Batum. The lands comprised 34% of the former empire's population, 54% of its industrial land, 89% of its coalfields, and 26% of its railways. The Soviet government also confirmed the independence of Finland, which it had recognized in January 1918, and pledged to end its war with the Ukrainian People's Republic, which the Central Powers had recognized under the prior Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (9 February 1918). A supplementary protocol signed in August 1918 required Russia to pay Germany war reparations of six billion marks. The treaty was controversial in Russia, giving a unifying cause to the White movement and opening a rift between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, whose representatives withdrew from the Council of People's Commissars after its signing and later rebelled in the Left SR Uprising.\n\nThe treaty was annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918,\\[1\\] in which Germany surrendered to the western Allied Powers. Subsequent attempts by the Soviets to restore power in the lost territories during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922) had mixed results, with the Red Army being defeated in the independence wars of the three Baltic countries and in the Polish–Soviet War, but successfully conquering Belarus early on,\\[2\\] later achieving victory in its invasions of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia and in Ukraine. The border with Turkey established by the treaty was largely affirmed by the Treaty of Kars (1921). Under the Treaty of Rapallo (1922), Russia and Germany renounced all territorial and financial claims against each other.\n\nThe Russian borders established by the treaty bear an almost exact similarity to the post-1991 borders established after the fall of the Soviet Union.\\[3\\]\n\nLev Kamenev arriving at Brest-Litovsk### Soviet-German financial agreement of August 1918\n\nFor the Western Allied Powers, the terms that Germany had imposed on Russia were interpreted as a warning of what to expect if the Central Powers won the war. Between Brest-Litovsk and the point when the situation in the Western Front became dire, some officials in the German government and the high command began to favour offering more lenient terms to the Allied Powers in exchange for their recognition of German gains in the east.\\[43\\]\n\nThe treaty marked a significant contraction of the territory controlled by the Bolsheviks or that they could lay claim to as effective successors of the Russian Empire. While the independence of Poland was already accepted by them in principle, and Lenin had signed a document accepting the Finnish independence, the loss of Ukraine and the Baltics created, from the Bolshevik perspective, dangerous bases of anti-Bolshevik military activity in the subsequent Russian Civil War (1917–1923). However, Bolshevik control of Ukraine and Transcaucasia was, at the time, fragile or non-existent.\\[44\\]\n\nMany Russian nationalists and some revolutionaries were furious at the Bolsheviks' acceptance of the treaty and joined forces to fight them. Non-Russians who inhabited the lands lost by Bolshevik Russia in the treaty saw the changes as an opportunity to set up independent states.\n\nImmediately after the signing of the treaty, Lenin moved the Soviet government from Petrograd to Moscow to prevent Germany from capturing the Russian capital in the event of an invasion.\\[45\\]\\[34\\] Trotsky blamed the peace treaty on the bourgeoisie, the social revolutionaries,\\[46\\] Tsarist diplomats, Tsarist bureaucrats, \"the Kerenskys, Tseretelis and Chernovs\",\\[47\\] the Tsarist regime, and the \"petty-bourgeois compromisers\".\\[48\\]\n\nThe treaty opened a permanent rift between the Bolsheviks and Left SRs. In July 1918 the Left SRs assassinated German Ambassador Wilhelm von Mirbach in the hopes that it would induce Germany to annul the treaty, leading to the Left SR Uprising.\\[49\\]\n\nA map of Europe in 1923 after the Russian Civil War, among other revolutions.\n\n[搜索关键词]:Franco-Soviet relations 1920s 1930s syndicalist France\n\n[编号]:[^6^]\n[标题]:USSR-France Relationship (1919-1933) – UPSC World History Notes - Blog\n[网站名称]:Edukemy\n[日期]: 2023-11-25\n片段 1：\n## Improvement in Relations (After 1930)\n\n-  _Reason_: The rise of the Nazis in Germany led to an increase in positivity in the Franco-Russian relationship.\n\n## **Key Themes:**\n\n### 1\\.

The subsequent October Revolution followed by a further military defeat brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which granted the Germans a significant victory and resulted in Russia exiting the war and breaking ties with the Allied Powers.\n\n### Learning Objective\n\nState the consequences of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\n\n### Key Points\n\n-  In March 1917, demonstrations in Russia culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak provisional government that shared power with the Petrograd Soviet socialists.\n\n-  This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home, with the Russian army becoming increasingly ineffective.\n\n-  Discontent and the weaknesses of the provisional government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party led by Vladimir Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war.\n\n-  The October Revolution, which put the Bolsheviks into power, was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany.\n\n-  At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on March 3, 1918.\n\n-  The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the Baltic provinces, parts of Poland, and Ukraine, to the Central Powers.\n\n-  The treaty was effectively terminated in November 1918 when Germany surrendered to the Allies.\n\n[搜索关键词]:Treaty of Brest-Litovsk if Germany victorious WW1 long-term\n\n[编号]:[^8^]\n[标题]:Brest-Litovsk: Eastern Europe's Forgotten Father\n[网站名称]:World War I Centennial\n[日期]: 2015-12-28\n片段 1：\n#### **by Adrian Bonenberger**\n\nTreaty of Brest Litovsk March 1918 map. Image courtesy of http://slideplayer.com/slide/4453652/\n\nWhat seemed like strength, however, ended up being the opposite, and vice versa. Germany insisted on and received its demands, and then found itself forced to garrison its new territories with nearly a million soldiers, overstretching its military and potentially robbing itself of the means by which to force a conclusion to the war before substantial numbers of Americans could arrive.\n\nThe garrisoning of soldiers did not come without its own risks—although the Bolsheviks had reluctantly agreed to terms that were widely viewed as humiliating, and were no longer in open conflict with Germany, that did not stop local Bolsheviks or their socialist allies from attempting to radicalize Germany’s soldiers. Furthermore, ethnic nationalists in Ukraine and Belarus felt that they had been mislead, and began small-scale insurgencies. What had seemed originally like a boon to the German war effort quickly turned into a cultural and logistical nightmare.\n\n**Long lasting effects**\n\nWhile these immediate effects of Brest-Litovsk were playing out—soon to be overcome by events when Germany lost the war—it’s the longer-term implications of the treaty that are most relevant today. Chiefly, the establishment of a clear legal precedent for an Eastern Europe to exist independent of Russia, in a basic form that endures to this day, along the model of countries to its West—but also, the basis for that precedent being rooted in the ethnic, historical, and linguistic identity of the people inhabiting those places. Although “Ukrainian” and “Belarusian” culture were recognized as such long before Brest-Litovsk, those things had not been viewed as sufficient for self-sustaining cultures, then—on the contrary, those identities made Ukrainians, Belarusians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians and (most of all, because of their powerful literary tradition) Poles exceptionally dangerous to Germany and to Russia. Germany facilitated the breaking of that longstanding tradition of subjugating Eastern European peoples, subsuming them into larger nations.\n\nThe Brest-Litovsk Treaty#### **by Adrian Bonenberger**\n\nThe Brest-Litovsk Treaty\n\nThe most immediate consequence, sadly for the Central Powers after their defeat, is that the same principles were applied to Germany and Austria-Hungary, and both countries were partitioned to create smaller nations (Germany much less so than Austria-Hungary, which was utterly destroyed). What had seemed like a good idea when applied to others was catastrophic when applied to them. And the scope of the Treaty of Versailles would likely not have been as sweeping or severe had not the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk been hovering over the proceedings.\n\nSo when you look at a map of Eastern Europe today, you’re looking at something fairly similar to the map drawn up by negotiators sitting around tables about 100 years ago, dreaming of a German empire, or of a worker-led socialist revolution. Funny how things work out.\n\n**And the circumstances explain a lot**\n\nA final point that’s worth making about Brest-Litovsk, Eastern Europe, and how it came about: the shape of those countries liberated or annexed by Germany were not put into their final form until 1946, for the most part, with pieces of Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland (to say nothing of Russia and Germany) shifting and changing repeatedly. In the case of Ukraine, if Russian occupation holds, one may be able to say that the shape of its country changed last in 2014.\n\nBut most of those changes were imposed externally; created by treaties or agreements by those larger powers. Few countries in Eastern Europe achieved independence or identity through war, or on their own terms, for better or for worse. Tim Snyder makes a compelling case in his book _Reconstruction of Nations_ that the closest “positive” national movement occurred in Poland’s handling of the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the end of the U.S.S.R.—by taking the initiative, unprompted, to relinquish outstanding potential claims on Ukrainian territory—that their action was itself a kind of positive national determination, that helped set the stage for further positive relationships between Eastern European countries. This was during a time when other areas, notably the former Yugoslavia, fell into extreme violence. There was no reason to believe or expect that would not be the case in Eastern Europe, especially given the two wars fought between Poland and Ukraine between 1918-19 and then 1943-46.\n\n[搜索关键词]:Trotsky foreign policy permanent revolution vs socialism in one country\n\n[编号]:[^9^]\n[标题]:Permanent revolution\n[网站名称]:wikipedia.org\n[日期]: 2003-07-01\n片段 1：\nThis article is about the theoretical term. For other uses, see Permanent Revolution.\n\n**Permanent revolution** is the strategy of a revolutionary class pursuing its own interests independently and without compromise or alliance with opposing sections of society. As a term within Marxist theory, it was first coined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels as early as 1850. Since then different theorists, most notably Leon Trotsky (1879–1940), have used the phrase to refer to different concepts.\n\nTrotsky's permanent revolution is an explanation of how socialist revolutions could occur in societies that have not achieved an advanced capitalist mode of production. Trotsky's theory also argues that the bourgeoisie in late-developing capitalist countries are incapable of developing the productive forces in such a manner as to achieve the sort of advanced capitalism which will fully develop an industrial proletariat; and that the proletariat can and must therefore seize social, economic and political power, leading an alliance with the peasantry. Trotsky also opposed Joseph Stalin's principle of socialism in one country and stated that socialist revolutions needed to happen across the world in order to combat the global capitalist hegemony. According to Russian historian Vadim Rogovin (1937–1998), the success of Stalin's theoretical position had a significant and negative impact on the entire course of the international revolutionary process.\\[1\\]\n\nMarx's view of \"permanent\" revolution sees revolutionary activity as continuously ongoing _until_ the revolutionary forces achieve a defined goal (such as socialism or communism).\\[2\\] This contrasts with the permanent (that is, ongoing _forever_) revolutionary activity envisaged in Maoist Continuous Revolution Theory.\\[ _citation needed_\\]## Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\n\n### Relation to Trotskyist theory\n\nAfter the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks, now including Trotsky, did not discuss the theory of permanent revolution as such. However, its basic theses can be found in such popular outlines of communist theory as _The ABC of Communism_ which sought to explain the program of the Bolshevik Party by Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Nikolai Bukharin. According to Russian historian, Vadim Rogovin, the leadership of the German Communist Party had requested that Moscow send Leon Trotsky to Germany to direct the 1923 insurrection. However, this proposal was rejected by the Politburo which was controlled by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev who decided to send a commission of lower-ranking Russian Communist Party members.\\[14\\]\n\nLater on after Lenin's death in the 1920s, the theory did assume importance in the internal debates within the Bolshevik Party and was a bone of contention within the opposition to Joseph Stalin. In essence, a section of the Bolshevik Party leadership, whose views were voiced at the theoretical level by Bukharin, argued that socialism could be built in a single country, even an underdeveloped one like Russia. Bukharin argued that Russia's pre-existing economic base was sufficient for the task at hand, provided the Soviet Union could be militarily defended.\n\nThe question of the Northern Expedition and the subjection of the Chinese Communist Party to control by the Kuomintang at the behest of the Bolshevik Party was a topic of argument within the opposition to Stalin in the party.\\[15\\] Figures such as Karl Radek argued that a stagist strategy was correct for China. (These writings were lost in the 1930s; if copies exist in the Soviet archives, they have not been located since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.) By contrast, Trotsky generalised his theory of permanent revolution, which had only been previously applied to Russia.

The definition is: For every element in the domain, there is exactly one element in the range. But “In the range, every value in the domain…” doesn’t make sense. So A is false.  \n- **B**: Domain can be empty (empty function exists), range will then be empty. So B is true.  \n- **C**: Domain and range can be any sets, not necessarily numbers.

Welcome to the “Artificial Intelligence in Medical Record Management” Forum co-hosted by Zhongshan Hospital and Pulmonary Hospital of Fudan University. Together we will advance the deep integration and application of AI in health care, focus on improving the quality of front-page medical records, and accelerate the creation of an intelligent medical paradigm that is human-machine collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and co-creative. We are honored to have leading experts deliver keynote speeches, share cases, and engage in interactive discussions on continuous quality improvement in medical records, thereby supporting the high-quality development of public hospitals. On behalf of Zhongshan Hospital, I extend our warmest welcome to all leaders, experts, and colleagues present.\n\nTo comprehensively elevate smart-hospital construction and align with the new demands of high-quality public-hospital development, Zhongshan Hospital follows the National Health Commission’s “Reference Guidance for AI Application Scenarios in Health Care.” Driven by the trinity of strategic planning, foundational support, and digital-intelligent innovation, we have seized the moment to evolve from “Internet +” to “AI +” in health care. We are building a “5G + digital-twin smart medical ecosystem” centered on three themes: fully connected patient services, high-efficiency clinical-teaching-research experiences for staff, and refined operational governance for administrators. Eight scenario clusters have been deployed across the entire care life-cycle: digital ORs, multi-network remote consultations, smart inpatient care, smart emergency response, smart teaching & research, a smart operations center, and flexible logistics. In March 2025, after closing the loop from “management need → R&D → coding validation,” we launched the pilot “AI-assisted front-page coding” project. Using high-quality coder-annotated data, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, front-page diagnostic coding concordance rose from 89.9 % to 90.5 % and procedure coding concordance from 87.5 % to 91.2 % by July, yielding a highly accurate, well-fitted coding model.\n\nThis forum answers the Commission’s three-year action plan for overall medical-quality enhancement. Aiming to raise the completeness and accuracy of front-page coding, we apply AI to boost coding review and quality-monitoring capacity and efficiency, augmenting record managers’ information cognition and shifting us from “information connection” to “knowledge creation.”\n\nMay this forum be both an academic gala for record management and a catalyst for deeper AI-healthcare integration. Let us pinpoint hospital needs, develop targeted intelligent scenarios, and swiftly translate research into operational projects that cut costs, raise efficiency, and give AI in record management a new burst of innovative speed.\n\nOnce again, welcome, and may your discussions be fruitful! I wish the forum every success!", "name": "resource"}, {"role": "user", "content": "顾建英副会长致欢迎辞：AI赋能病案质控，由“信息互联”跃向“知识共创”，共筑人机协同、跨界融合的智慧医疗新生态。"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vice President Gu Jianying emphasized in her speech that AI-assisted medical record coding review and quality control represent a critical leap for Shanghai hospitals toward “knowledge creation,” jointly shaping a new paradigm of smart healthcare characterized by human-machine collaboration and cross-disciplinary integration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Too brief; it can be under 200 characters."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In her welcome address, Vice President Gu Jianying stated that AI-assisted medical record coding review and quality monitoring are the key levers for implementing the national three-year initiative and improving the quality of front-page data.

I sincerely thank the Medical Record Management Committee of the Shanghai Hospital Association for inviting me to deliver this opening address at the First Shanghai Academic Symposium on the Effective Application of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Record Management. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, I extend warm congratulations on the successful convening of this symposium!\n\nArtificial intelligence is a key driver of the new round of technological and industrial transformation. As AI technology matures, its synergistic development with all sectors accelerates, and the concept of “AI+” has taken root in people’s minds. Recently, the State Council issued the “Opinions on Deepening the Implementation of the ‘AI+’ Action,” clarifying the overall requirements, development goals and priority directions of the initiative. In addition, the National Health Commission and other agencies have formulated the “Reference Guidelines for AI Application Scenarios in the Health Sector,” providing a roadmap for further integrating AI with healthcare, fostering new quality productive forces, and accelerating the formation of smart hospitals and intelligent medical care.\n\nMedical record management is an essential component of healthcare work. It underpins medical quality, safety and efficiency, and serves as a foundation for the development of the entire health system. Centered on the theme “Effective Application of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Record Management,” this symposium focuses on the latest research findings, practical experience and development trends of AI in this field, offering experts and peers a platform to exchange ideas, share experiences and discuss challenges.\n\nI hope that through today’s in-depth discussions and extensive exchanges, medical record professionals will zero in on the pain points and difficulties in applying AI, continuously improve the accuracy and stability of AI algorithms, thoroughly study the mechanisms by which AI functions in this domain, seize the opportunity as “Internet+” evolves into “AI+,” and develop technology products and solutions that truly meet the practical needs of medical record management. At the same time, we must emphasize data governance and security, strengthen standardized management, safeguard data, and lay a solid, secure data foundation for the widespread application of AI. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission will continue to support the Medical Record Management Committee in building a multidisciplinary talent pool that understands both healthcare and AI technology as well as medical record management, actively promoting the deep application of AI in this field, injecting new momentum into Shanghai’s medical record management, and continuously raising its standards.\n\nFinally, I wish this symposium complete success, and good health, smooth work and every success to all experts and colleagues!\n\nThank you!", "name": "resource"}, {"role": "user", "content": "上海市卫生健康委副主任狄建忠指出，AI与医疗深度融合，必须以质量安全为底线、以标准规范为基石、以数据治理为核心。上海将率先打造病案智能化管理“样板间”，推动全域病历一单通、质控一码管、科研一键调，为超大城市精准治理和高质量发展提供“卫健样板”。"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "搜索若干个(最多不超过5个)queries\n注意 search 返回的是“所有 url 上匹配度最高的几个片段”，所以信息量有可能是不完全的", "parameters": {"properties": {"queries": {"description": "需要搜索的所有queries", "items": {"type": "string"}, "type": "array"}}, "required": ["queries"], "type": "object"}}, "type": "function"}, {"function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "description": "Fetches URLs from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

While writing, he let his brush gallop freely, following his heart, yet never overstepped the rules; orderly, natural, gathered without crowding or chaos, released without excess or drift. In brush movement he gave full play to the strength within each stroke, yet the expression remained reserved, hidden rather than flaunted.  \n\nWang Duo’s running script tilts left-low right-high, tight in the middle, large on top and small below, the four corners comparatively open, especially the final strokes at the lower left, lower right and tail, all displaying a free character. The last vertical is often written slanted, right-leaning or left-leaning, sometimes even curved, revealing surging emotion. He emphasizes horizontal momentum, spreading left and right. Of course, he keeps release within measure, expansion within control.  \n\nIn character structure he is expansive yet gathered, danger seen within uprightness. Character size, length, width, square-round, straight-slant, fat-thin vary endlessly; every single structure is in flux—this is a hallmark of his calligraphy.  \n\nIn overall layout he pays attention not only to the seeming slant yet real uprightness of single characters, manipulating the relations among components, but also treats several characters, one line, or an entire piece as a unit, handling such slant-upright variation. Each character appears to tilt and wobble, yet through mutual adjustment among characters, the staggered undulation of line alignment, and the black-white handling within, between, and among lines, balance and harmony are restored. Added to this, Wang Duo’s running script often contains cursive script; the fusion creates rising-falling, opposites-unified effects, still more unfettered and varied. In this art of treatment he reached true perfection.  \n\nWang Duo created lines suited to his style: his brush is multifaceted—square-round, straight-side, elegant yet fierce, spreading-twisting, breaking-gathering, nothing impossible; lines blend firm and soft, softness within firmness, soft yet forceful, giving a sense of resilient inner strength. Thick-thin contrasts are apt: some like ancient vines’ old trunks, some like new shoots hanging over cliffs, dancing in the wind; within the beautiful picture emerges a poetic, song-like mood.  \n\nHis ink moves from wet to dry, dry to parched, from richest to palest, from swollen to thirsty, moist and dry alternating, used with perfect rhythm. He successfully employed the “swollen-ink” method, letting ink flow and swell to glue strokes into planes, simplifying form and avoiding fussiness, while creating plane-line contrasts that heighten expression and enhance the work’s spirit.  \n\nNo imitation can reach the realm of Wang Duo’s calligraphy. Forgers, fearing inexactness, hold their brush timidly, rigidly regular, afraid to let go; or they deliberately twist, producing awkwardness; or their strokes are stiff, especially at turning points, overly mechanical. A final vertical often lacks strength and fails to gather; a final slash or flick is often light and slippery. When several such strokes appear, their forms are identical, devoid of variation. Fakes often knot and distort at structural turns; strokes are either over-forced, harsh and harsh, or under-forced, shallow and weak—far from the thick, raw vitality of the genuine.  \n\n4. Character usage and signature seals  \n\nAncient masters, erudite and learned, often used rare and variant characters; some forms were unique, Wang Duo being no exception.  \n\nSome current simplified characters were earlier variants or cursive forms, so identical forms in ancient calligraphy are unsurprising.  \n\nWang Duo liked relatively simplified variants. Some shared radicals with today’s simplified forms: e.g. “speech” radical simplified to “讠”, “gate” radical to “门”, “bed” radical to “丬”. Examples: 语, 诵, 诸, 谢, 诚; 问; 将.  \n\nOthers matching simplified forms: 与, 绿, 气, 险, 来, 尔, 栖.  \n\nSome were then-current cursive or rare forms: e.g. 度 written as , 西 as , 渔 as , 法 as , 受 as , 雷 as , 契 as , 原 as , 思 as , 农 as , 蛇 as , 蟪 as . He once wrote 刘 as 馏—rarely recognized even at the time.  \n\nWang Duo’s signatures appear mostly in cursive, less in running script. Signatures are the easiest tell: genuine ones are fluent and natural; forgers, though deliberate, always appear awkward, especially cursive signatures, like dead snakes writhing. Some fakers, unclear about stroke direction, twist randomly, unsightly.  \n\nHis seals include: 王铎之印, 觉斯, 王铎, 宗伯之章, 大宗伯印, 觉斯父, 烟潭渔叟, 大学士章, etc.", "tool_call_id": "functions.search:1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a previous search result, I noticed a link [^8^] to the “Wang Duo Calligraphy Dictionary,” which includes the character “涛.” Wang Duo was a renowned calligrapher of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, celebrated for his running-cursive script; his style should offer valuable reference for the running-script form of “涛” in “王竟涛.” I will therefore visit that link to see if I can locate an image of “涛” in running script, providing you with a more direct visual reference.", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "id": "functions.urls_fetch_tool:2", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "urls_fetch_tool", "arguments": "{\"urls\": [\"http://www.guoxuedashi.com/2196/\"]}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "URL: http://www.guoxuedashi.com/2196/\nTitle: _Guoxue Master\nContent: About Us | Add to Favorites | Submissions Welcome | Comments & Suggestions | Guoxue Fan\n\nCopyright © Guoxue Master Classical Books Integration All Rights Reserved.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a non-profit site.

Listed by period and author for easy reference; each is followed by a one-line cue to its color and feeling.\n\n1. Sky-Clear Sand · Autumn Thoughts  \n   Ma Zhiyuan  \n   Withered vines, old tree, dusk crows; small bridge, running water, homestead; ancient road, west wind, lean horse. Sun slants west: heart-broken man at sky’s edge.  \n   Cue: Twenty-eight characters paint “autumn dusk of a wanderer,” hailed as the ancestor of all autumn laments.\n\n2. Sky-Clear Sand · Autumn (also titled simply Autumn)  \n   Bai Pu  \n   Lonely village, setting sun, fading rose clouds; thin smoke, old tree, cold crows; one wild-goose shadow drops. Blue hills, green waters, white grass, red leaves, yellow flowers.  \n   Cue: From bleak to brilliant, a color-soaked autumn diptych.\n\n3. Sky-Clear Sand · Autumn  \n   Zhu Tingyu  \n   Before the court, every phoenix-tree leaf has fallen; by the water, lotus blooms are fully open—sharing the poet’s mood. Frosted leaves leave their branch and fly to me for a red-ink inscription.  \n   Cue: Parlor trees versus pond blooms, garden autumn’s solitude and refinement.\n\n4. Great-Virtue Song · Autumn  \n   Guan Hanqing  \n   Wind flutters, rain spits; even the sleep-immortal Chen Tuan could not doze…Autumn cicadas finish, cold crickets begin; a fine thin drizzle taps the plantain.  \n   Cue: Rain, insect, plantain—each sound a stroke of autumn-night fretwork.\n\n5. Clear-River Refrain · Autumn Heart  \n   Zhang Kejiu  \n   West wind brings word from home ten thousand li, asking my return date. Wild geese cry beneath red-leaf skies; drunk on yellow-flower ground, I dream to the sound of rain on plantain.  \n   Cue: West wind, homing goose, yellow chrysanthemum, plantain—every line adds another layer of homesick autumn.\n\n6. Clear-River Refrain · Autumn Dwelling  \n   Wu Xiyi  \n   White geese scatter like autumn snow; clear dew chills the night…Star-brimming sky—man asleep.  \n   Cue: Geese as snow, dew as frost, a traveler under star-river—cool, crisp, free.\n\n7. Drunk in East Wind · Autumn Scene  \n   Lu Zhi  \n   On sheer cliff, a withered pine leans upside-down; with falling afterglow, lone wild duck wings level…Carry me inside a Xiao-Xiang scroll.  \n   Cue: Mountain, water, sunset, duck—cinematic “autumn boat on Xiao-Xiang.”\n\n8. Water-Fairy · Night Rain  \n   Xu Zaisi  \n   One wutong leaf, one drop of autumn; one plantain drip, one grain of sorrow…all reach the heart.  \n   Cue: Night rain counts out ten years of exile and parents’ whitening hair, leaf by leaf, drop by drop.\n\nReading tips  \n• Yuan short songs are perfect for a quiet autumn afternoon or lamplight; add a cup of yellow wine or bitter tea and the “autumn taste” deepens.  \n• For more, collect the individual anthologies of Ma Zhiyuan, Bai Pu, and Zhang Kejiu—they wrote the most, and the most typical, autumn pieces."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summer's Yuan Qu"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "Web Search API.

to warm our collective  \n- Footer: X/X/202X  \n\nImage  \n- Light-blue gradient background, bottom-left semi-transparent simplified Youth League emblem.  \n- Main title: bold Heiti 36 pt; subtitle: KaiTi 28 pt dark gray; footer: SimSun 14 pt.  \n\nScript  \n(smile, 2-second pause)  \nHello everyone, I’m XXX. Today I want to use this PPT to tell you why I’m running—not to be a “high-up cadre,” but to be the teammate who reaches out and gets things done.\n\nSlide 2: About Me  \nCopy  \n- Basics: XXX | Suzhou, Jiangsu | Major XX Class XX | Communist Youth League member  \n- Tags: Ice-breaker · Ready helper · Closer  \n- Track record: As high-school class president, compiled a “Hobby Handbook” for 32 classmates so we clicked within a week; for two weeks straight I typed up math notes for a sick classmate and checked his progress daily so he didn’t fall behind.  \n\nImage  \n- Left third: round cropped smiling photo, light-blue border.  \n- Right two-thirds: top—basics & color-box tags; bottom—bullet points starting with ✅.  \n\nScript  \n(pointing at photo)  \nQuick intro: I’m from Suzhou. In high school I made that hobby handbook—suddenly guitar people found guitar people, board-game fans found board-game fans, and the room warmed up. For the sick classmate I asked “Got this part?” every day until he said “All clear,” because I finish what I start.\n\nSlide 3: My Edge  \nCopy  \n- Edge 1: Proactive – Already double-checked contact info for 15 classmates so nothing’s missing.  \n- Edge 2: Coordinator – Rescheduled three class events into staggered slots, pushing attendance from 60 % to 90 %.  \n- Edge 3: Closer – Todo-list addict; high-school class tasks 100 % done with feedback.  \n\nImage  \nThree equal columns: icon (👋 🤝 📝), bold title, one-line proof; columns tinted light gray / blue / green with rounded corners.  \n\nScript  \n(pointing)  \nThree reasons I’ll deliver: First, I proactively verified every phone number. Second, I asked everyone’s free periods, re-booked events, and 90 % showed. Third, I carry a notebook—task done, tick; task failed, never happened.\n\nSlide 4: What the Job Means  \nCopy  \nTitle: To me, Branch Secretary = 3 Roles  \n1. Paperwork clerk – Handle Youth League transfers, “Youth Learning” modules, spare you the hassle.  \n2. Ice-breaker – Launch activities so we click fast.  \n3. Go-to pal – Collect needs, give feedback, make everyone feel owned.  \n\nImage  \nTop-centered title; below, three “pin-shape” cards with circle icons (file, people, heart) and wrapped text.  \n\nScript  \n(eye contact)  \nIt’s not an “office,” it’s three jobs: clerk who kills red tape, ice-breaker who throws the first activity, and pal you can DM any worry.\n\nSlide 5: 30-Day Action Plan  \nCopy  \nTitle: If elected, I’ll do these 3 things in Month 1  \n1.

Their core distinctions can be summarized as:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Core Purpose  \n- **Heatmap**  \n  **Pattern discovery**: Uses color intensity to reveal density, frequency, or strength, helping users instantly spot anomalies, hotspots, or cold zones.  \n  *Examples*: website click heatmap (red = high-click areas), traffic flow heatmap (red = congested roads).\n\n- **Dashboard**  \n  **Real-time status monitoring**: Aggregates multi-dimensional KPIs, presenting them as charts, numbers, or progress bars that update live for rapid decision-making.  \n  *Examples*: server CPU usage, real-time sales, IoT device status panel.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Data & Time Characteristics  \n| Dimension        | Heatmap                              | Dashboard                          |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Time**         | Static or quasi-static (e.g., past 24 h aggregate) | Real-time (second/minute refresh) |\n| **Granularity**  | High-dimensional spatial data (geo, page coords) | Structured metrics (values, %, trends) |\n| **Interaction**  | Light (zoom, hover for details)      | Rich (filter, drill-down, alerts)  |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Visual Design  \n- **Heatmap**  \n  – Color mapping is central (e.g., red-yellow-green for high-med-low).  \n  – Overlaid on maps, screenshots, matrices.  \n- **Dashboard**  \n  – Mixed widgets (line charts, gauges, tables, alert lights).  \n  – Emphasizes tidy layout and info hierarchy (top-left = critical KPI).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Typical Use Cases  \n- **Heatmap**  \n  – UX optimization: analyze clicks, dwell time.  \n  – Scientific viz: gene expression, urban density.  \n- **Dashboard**  \n  – Ops monitoring: server health, network latency.  \n  – Business monitoring: live sales, inventory alerts.\n\n---\n\n### One-liner  \nA **heatmap** is the color-speaking detective; a **dashboard** is the metric-watching steward."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What does a heat map look like?"}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}, "response": {"id": "9d88d7f1-83ed-441f-9c91-04f86d060a59", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1769569388, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "A heatmap is a **color-coded grid or matrix** where colors represent values, making patterns instantly visible. Here’s what one typically looks like:\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Structure**\n1. **Grid of cells** – arranged in rows and columns.\n2. **Color scale** – from cool (low values) to warm (high values), often using gradients like:\n   - **Blue → Yellow → Red** (common in scientific data)\n   - **Green → Yellow → Red** (common in performance dashboards)\n   - **Single-hue gradients** (e.g., light to dark blue)\n3. **Axes labels** – row and column labels to identify what each cell represents.\n4. **Legend** – explains the color-to-value mapping.\n\n---\n\n### **Common Layout Examples**\n\n#### **1. Matrix Heatmap (e.g., correlation matrix)**\n```\n        A      B      C      D\n    ┌─────────────────────────┐\n  A │ ████   ██     █        │\n  B │ ██     ████   ██       │\n  C │ █      ██     ████     │\n  D │        █      ██   ████│\n    └─────────────────────────┘\n    Legend: ████ = 1.0 (red), █ = 0.2 (blue)\n```\n*Used in data science to show relationships between variables.*\n\n#### **2. Geographic Heatmap (e.g., population density)**\n- A map (like a city or country) overlaid with translucent color blobs.\n- **Red/orange** = high density/activity.\n- **Blue/green** = low density/activity.\n*Example: Google Maps traffic overlay, Uber surge pricing zones.*\n\n#### **3. Web Click Heatmap**\n- A screenshot of a webpage with semi-transparent color layers on top.\n- **Red** = most clicked areas.\n- **Blue** = rarely clicked areas.\n*Example: Hotjar or Crazy Egg visualizations.*\n\n#### **4. Calendar Heatmap (e.g., GitHub contribution graph)**\n```\n    Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr ...\nMon ██   █    ███  ████\nTue ███  ██   █    ██\nWed █    ███  ██   █\n...\n```\n*Each cell is a day, color shows activity level (e.g., commits, hours worked).*\n\n---\n\n### **Real-World Image Analogy**\nIf you imagine:\n- A **chessboard** where each square is colored by how many times it was visited.\n- A **weather map** showing temperature (red = hot, blue = cold).\n- A **seating chart** shaded by ticket sales.\n\n---\n\n### **Why It Works**\n- **Pre-attentive processing**: Your brain decodes color intensity faster than numbers.\n- **Pattern spotting**: Clusters, outliers, and gradients “pop” visually.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Example in Table Form**\n|       | Product A | Product B | Product C |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Jan   | ████      | ██        | █         |\n| Feb   | ███       | ████      | ██        |\n| Mar   | ██        | █         | ████      |\n*Where ████ = dark red (high sales), █ = light blue (low sales).*\n\nIn short, a heatmap turns a table of numbers into a **visual story told in color**.", "tool_calls": null}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": null}, "status": "success", "finish_reason": "stop", "tool_calls_valid": null, "last_run_at": "2026-01-28T11:03:33.638645", "duration_ms": 27538, "hash": "a2e170ac995f888b2668d27a3d7e70ca"}

The GPU’s role is to handle all visual-related tasks, such as video games, videos, etc., while the CPU handles almost everything else.\n\nWith so many processors available on the market and various price ranges, finding the suitable one is never uncomplicated.\n\nTo ensure that anybody reading this article makes an informed decision, we have created this **hierarchy of CPUs** from the recent few generations to help you determine what you require.\n\nWe are ranking the CPUs in tiers based on their performance in gaming and productivity.\n\nWithout further delay, here is the final CPU hierarchy list!\n\nNote: Intel’s 12th-gen CPUs have P (performance), E (effective), and T (threads) indicators under Cores/Threads\n\nTable of ContentsShow\n\n1.  S Tier\n\n2.  A Tier\n\n3.  B Tier\n\n4.  C Tier\n\n5.  D Tier\n\n6.  Final Words On The CPU Hierarchy\n\nThe **premium** is where the most potent and costly processors belong. These CPUs are for users wanting to **enhance their FPS** in the most visually challenging games or to do **complex work**.\n\nTo achieve top-notch productivity, consider the third-gen Threadripper. It provides exceptional price-to-performance value. One model, the Threadripper 3990X, boasts 64 cores and costs $4000.\n\nAlternatively, the **Threadripper 3960X** is priced at **$1,400** with 24 cores and 48 threads. If you are searching for an Intel solution, the i9-10980XE has 18 cores/ 36 threads at $1000. We wouldn’t suggest these for gaming, though.\n\nTo obtain exceptional quality and favorable bargains, consider Intel’s high-grade processors like the i9-13900K, i7-13700K, and i5-13600K. They are priced at $589, $409, and $319, respectively. The 12th gen SKUs are also a wise option.\n\nAMD also offers outstanding gaming performance for a fair value with the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, Ryzen 7 7700X, and Ryzen 5 7600X.\n\nHowever, AMD’s Ryzen non-X CPUs like the **Ryzen 9 7900**, **Ryzen 7 7700**, and **Ryzen 5 7600** have an even more outstanding price-to-performance ratio.\n\nThe recently released **Ryzen 9 7950X3D** and **Ryzen 7 7800X3D** are the fastest gaming CPUs in the world, followed closely by the **Ryzen 9 7900X3D**.\n\nThe rest of the Ryzen 7000 series, like the **Ryzen 9 7900X** and **Ryzen 9 7950X**, are also reliable options, especially if you’re leaning toward creative work.\n\nAMD’s **Ryzen 5950X**, **5900X,** and **5700X** are also quite fast CPUs, so they deserve this S-tier classification. The MSRPs are $799, $549, and $299 respectively.\n\n### Gaming\n\n||Model|Boost Clock|Cores/Threads|TDP|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|1.|Ryzen 7 7800X3D|5.0 GHz|8/16|120W|\n|2.|Ryzen 9 7950X3D|5.7 GHz|16/32|120W|\n|3.|Ryzen 9 7900X3D|5.6 GHz|12/24|120W|\n|4.|Intel Core i9-13900K/KS|5.8 GHz|8P/16E/32T|125W|\n|5.|Ryzen 7 7700X|5.4 GHz|8/12|105W|\n|6.|Intel Core i7-13700K|5.4 GHz|8P/8E/24T|125W|\n|7.|Ryzen 9 7950X|5.7 GHz|16/32|170W|\n|8.|Ryzen 9 7900X|5.6 GHz|12/24|170W|\n|9.|Ryzen 5 7600X|5.3 GHz|6/12|105W|\n|10.|Ryzen 9 7900|5.4 GHz|12/24|65W|\n|11.|Ryzen 7 7700|5.3 GHz|8/16|65W|\n|12.|Ryzen 5 7600|5.1 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|13.|Ryzen 7 5800X3D|4.8 GHz|8/16|105W|\n|14.|Intel Core i5-13600K|5.1 GHz|6P/8E/20T|125W|\n|16.|Intel Core i9-12900KS|5.5 GHz|8P/8E/24T|150W|\n|17.|_Intel Core i9-12900K_|5.2 GHz|8P/8E/24T|125W|\n|18.|_AMD Ryzen 9 5950X_|4.9 GHz|16/32|105W|\n|19.|_IntelCore i7-12700K_|5.0 GHz|8P/4E/20T|125W|\n\n**P – Performance cores, E – Efficiency cores, T – Threads**## A Tier\n\nThe A-tier of CPUs consists of recent and older generation CPUs that do not cost an arm and a leg and have a diminished core count.\n\nHere, we have the **Ryzen 5 5600X** and the **Ryzen 5 5600** competing against Intel’s **i5-11600K**. Both of these CPUs are similarly priced and have 6 cores/12 threads. They are also considerably cheaper than S-tier CPUs at around $300.\n\nHowever, the Ryzen 5 5600 is a significantly superior affordable choice as it only costs **$200**.\n\nThe Ryzen **5700G** and **5600G** (AMD’s processors with built-in graphics) can also be positioned here, just under the **i9-10900**.\n\nWe also have the processors from two generations ago, the **10700K** and **10900K**.\n\nAMD’s third generation also deserves a place in the top tier. Particularly the Ryzen 3900X and 3700X variants.\n\nIntel’s i3-12100F might appear as simply another i3 with 8 threads only, but it actually performs quite exceptionally, exchanging blows with the 11400F, 3700X, and extra CPUs.## A Tier\n\nWe also have the processors from two generations ago, the **10700K** and **10900K**.\n\nAMD’s third generation also deserves a place in the top tier.

Don’t be mistaken; the processors in this category are still more than capable of handling modern games and outputting competitive FPS. Second-tier processors might provide the ideal price-per-performance of all these options.\n\nThe Ryzen 3600 was and possibly still is one of AMD’s most cherished processors. A processor with 12 threads and reasonable power consumption sold for just $200. How can someone not adore it?\n\nThese days, you could probably obtain the 3600 or even the **3600X** for as little as $180.\n\nRyzen 3600, one of AMD’s most valued CPUs.\n\nSome of Intel’s 9th-generation CPUs also fit here flawlessly. The **9900K** and even the 8-thread **9700K** are still sufficient enough. Of course, this is at a much cheaper price than MSRP.\n\n||Model|Boost Clock|Cores/Threads|TDP|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|1.|_IntelCore i9-9900K_|5.0 GHz|8/16|95W|\n|2.|_IntelCore i7-9700K_|4.9 GHz|8/8|95W|\n|3.|_Intel Core i9-9900_|5.0 GHz|8/16|65W|\n|4.|_Intel Core i7-9700_|4.7 GHz|8/8|65W|\n|5.|_AMD Ryzen 5 5500_|4.2 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|6.|_AMD Ryzen 5 3600X_|4.4 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|7.|_AMD Ryzen 5 3600_|4.2 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|8.|_AMD Ryzen 3 3300X_|4.3 GHz|4/8|95W|\n|9.|_IntelCore i5-9600K_|4.6 GHz|6/6|95W|## C Tier\n\nWe have entered the group of processors that are starting to reveal their age, shortage of cores, and power, especially when it comes to the latest video games.\n\nAMD’s second generation of Ryzen still provides exceptional value, but its IPC is rather mediocre, leaving a lot to be desired. The same goes for Intel’s 9th generation i5s and i3s.\n\nThe Ryzen **2700X** is a reasonably solid option as you can grab it for less than $200 and get an 8-core and 16-thread CPU. However, this is Zen+, don’t mistake it for AMD’s Zen 2 (3600, 3700X, etc.). It is significantly slower in single-core performance.\n\nIntel’s i5s (such as the **9400F)** are also obsolete, considering they are locked to just 6 threads while i3s are stuck at 4 threads. That’s **too inadequate** by today’s standards.\n\n||Model|Boost Clock|Cores/Threads|TDP|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|1.|_IntelCore i3-10300_|4.4 GHz|4/8|65W|\n|2.|_IntelCore i5-9400/F_|4.1 GHz|6/6|65W|\n|3.|_IntelCore i3-10100_|4.3 GHz|4/8|65W|\n|4.|_AMD Ryzen 7 2700X_|4.3 GHz|8/16|105W|\n|5.|_AMD Ryzen Pro 4750G_|4.4 GHz|8/16|65W|\n|6.|_AMD Ryzen 3 3100_|3.9 GHz|4/8|65W|\n|7.|_AMD Ryzen 3400G_|4.2 GHz|4/8|65W|## D Tier\n\nThis is the D-level, a group of CPUs that can significantly impede your GPU from reaching its maximum capability, especially if you possess a high-end GPU like an RTX 3090 or RX 6900XT.\n\nEven considering the modest costs of CPUs such as the **2600X**, **i3-9100,** and others, they are challenging to recommend as there are similarly priced SKUs with substantially better performance.\n\n||Model|Boost Clock|Cores/Threads|TDP|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|_1._|_AMD Ryzen 7 2700_|4.1 GHz|8/16|65W|\n|_2._|_AMD Ryzen 5 2600X_|4.2 GHz|6/12|95W|\n|_3._|_AMD Ryzen 5 2600_|3.9 GHz|6/12|65W|\n|_4._|_Intel Core i3-9100_|4.2 GHz|4/4|65W|\n|_5._|_AMD Ryzen 3 3200G_|4.0 GHz|4/4|65W|\n|_6._|_AMD Ryzen 5 2400G_|3.9 GHz|4/8|65W|\n|_7._|_AMD Ryzen 3 2200G_|3.7 GHz|4/4|65W|\n|_8._|_Intel Pentium G6605_|4.3 GHz|2/4|58W|\n\n## Final Words On The CPU Hierarchy\n\nThis tiered list contains approximately 40 CPUs. That is a relatively small number considering there are hundreds of CPUs out there. However, we decided to limit our list to the final three generations of processors from both AMD and Intel.\n\nThere are also some exclusions from the latest generations as some CPUs can only be bought as part of an OEM PC or pre-built systems.\n\nThese CPU rankings are based on numerous review websites and YouTube tech channels, including Tom’s Hardware, Hardware Unboxed, and Gamers Nexus.

Imagine you're giving instructions to a very obedient but extremely literal-minded robot friend.\n\nIf you say: \"Please bring me a glass of water,\" the robot might:\n1. Stand still (because you didn't say to walk)\n2. Or bring you the glass without water (because you didn't mention filling it)\n3. Or bring you an empty glass from the bathroom instead of the kitchen\n\nComputers are exactly like this robot - they follow instructions PRECISELY. A **program** is simply a list of these extremely specific instructions written in a language the computer understands.\n\n### What is Rust?\n\n**Rust** is one of these languages we use to write instructions for computers. Think of it like learning French or Spanish, but instead of talking to people, you're talking to computers.\n\nRust is special because:\n- It helps prevent many common mistakes\n- It runs very fast\n- It's used to build important software like web browsers, operating systems, and game engines\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Setting Up Your Computer\n\nBefore we start programming, we need to prepare your computer. This is like setting up a kitchen before you can cook.\n\n### Step 1: Installing Rust\n\n**Windows:**\n1. Open your web browser\n2. Go to: https://rustup.rs/\n3. Click the big button that says \"rustup-init.exe\"\n4. When it downloads, double-click to run it\n5. Press **1** when it asks for installation options\n6. Wait for it to finish (this might take 5-10 minutes)\n\n**Mac:**\n1. Open \"Terminal\" (you can find it by pressing Cmd+Space and typing \"terminal\")\n2. Copy and paste this command:\n   ```bash\n   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n   ```\n3. Press Enter and follow the instructions\n\n**Linux:**\n1. Open your terminal\n2. Use the same command as Mac:\n   ```bash\n   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Testing Your Installation\n\nAfter installation, close your terminal/command prompt and reopen it. Then type:\n\n```bash\nrustc --version\n```\n\nYou should see something like:\n```\nrustc 1.75.0 (82e1608df 2023-12-21)\n```\n\nDon't worry if the numbers are different - this just means it worked!\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Your First Program Explained\n\nLet's write the simplest possible program. This tradition is called \"Hello, World!\" - it's like learning to say \"Hello\" in a new language.\n\n### Creating Your Program\n\n1. Create a new folder on your desktop called \"rust-learning\"\n2. Open your terminal/command prompt\n3. Navigate to this folder:\n   - Windows: `cd Desktop\\rust-learning`\n   - Mac/Linux: `cd Desktop/rust-learning`\n4. Create a new project:\n   ```bash\n   cargo new hello_world\n   ```\n5. Go into the new folder:\n   ```bash\n   cd hello_world\n   ```\n\n### Understanding Your First Code\n\nOpen the file `hello_world/src/main.rs` in any text editor (like Notepad). You'll see:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n```\n\nLet's understand EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER:\n\n#### Line 1: `fn main() {`\n\n- **`fn`**: This is short for \"function\". Think of a function like a recipe - it's a set of instructions with a name.\n- **`main`**: This is the name of our function. The computer always starts with the `main` function - it's like the first page of instructions.\n- **`()`**: These parentheses are where we would put ingredients (called \"parameters\") if our recipe needed any. Empty means no ingredients needed.\n- **`{`**: This curly bracket means \"start of instructions\". Everything between `{` and `}` belongs to this function.\n\n#### Line 2: `    println!(\"Hello, world!\");`\n\n- **`println!`**: This is a command that means \"print line\". The `!` is special - it tells us this is a \"macro\" (a special kind of command).\n- **`(`**: Opening parenthesis for the command\n- **`\"Hello, world!\"`**: This is called a \"string\" - think of it as text wrapped in quotes\n- **`)`**: Closing parenthesis for the command\n- **`;`**: This semicolon means \"end of this instruction\". It's like a period at the end of a sentence.\n\n#### Line 3: `}`\n\n- **`}`**: This closes our function - it means \"end of instructions for main\"\n\n### Running Your Program\n\nIn your terminal, type:\n```bash\ncargo run\n```\n\nYou should see:\n```\n   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s\n     Running `target/debug/hello_world`\nHello, world!\n```\n\nCongratulations! You just wrote and ran your first computer program!\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Understanding Every Detail\n\n### What is Cargo?\n\nCargo is like a helpful assistant for Rust programming. It:\n- Builds (compiles) your programs\n- Downloads helpful tools (called \"crates\")\n- Manages your project files\n\n### What is \"Compiling\"?\n\nComputers don't understand Rust directly. Compiling is like translation - it converts your Rust code into instructions the computer can understand.\n\nThink of it like this:\n- You write in English (Rust code)\n- The compiler translates to Machine Language (0s and 1s)\n- The computer runs the translated version\n\n### Understanding Files and Folders\n\nYour `hello_world` folder looks like this:\n\n```\nhello_world/\n├── Cargo.toml          # Project configuration (like a recipe book cover)\n├── src/\n│   └── main.rs         # Your actual code (the recipe)\n└── target/             # Where compiled programs go\n```\n\n**Cargo.toml** contains information about your project:\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"hello_world\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\n```\n\nEach part means:\n- **`[package]`**: This section describes your project\n- **`name`**: What you call your project\n- **`version`**: What version this is (starts at 0.1.0)\n- **`edition`**: Which version of Rust rules to use\n- **`[dependencies]`**: Where you list any helper tools you want to use\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Making Changes\n\nLet's modify your program to understand it better.\n\n### Experiment 1: Changing the Message\n\nChange `main.rs` to:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, my name is [Your Name]!\");\n    println!(\"I'm learning Rust programming!\");\n}\n```\n\nRun it with `cargo run` again.\n\n### Experiment 2: Multiple Lines\n\nAdd more lines:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n    println!(\"This is my second line\");\n    println!(\"Rust is fun!\");\n}\n```\n\n### Understanding the Output\n\nNotice that each `println!` creates a new line. This is why it's called \"print LINE\" - it automatically adds a line break after each message.\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Common Questions and Troubleshooting\n\n### \"I got an error!\"\n\nDon't worry - errors are normal! Let's decode common ones:\n\n**Error: \"expected one of ., ;\"**\n- This means you forgot a semicolon `;` at the end of a line\n\n**Error: \"unresolved import\"**\n- This means you tried to use something that doesn't exist\n\n**Error: \"no such file or directory\"**\n- Make sure you're in the right folder when running `cargo run`\n\n### \"Nothing happens when I run cargo run\"\n- Make sure you saved your file after making changes\n- Check that you're in the correct folder (the one with Cargo.toml)\n\n### \"I don't understand something\"\n- That's completely normal! Programming takes time to learn\n- Try reading the explanation out loud\n- Take breaks and come back to it\n\n---\n\n## Part 7: Practice Exercises\n\nTry these to reinforce your learning:\n\n### Exercise 1: Personal Introduction\nCreate a program that prints:\n```\nHello! My name is [your name].\nI'm learning Rust programming.\nToday is [day of week].\n```\n\n### Exercise 2: ASCII Art\nCreate a program that prints a simple picture:\n```\n    /\\_/\\\n   ( o.o )\n    > ^ <\n```\n\n### Exercise 3: Multiple Messages\nCreate a program that prints:\n```\nStarting program...\nLoading...\nWelcome to Rust!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Part 8: What's Next?\n\nIn the next lesson, we will learn about:\n- **Variables**: How to store and use information\n- **Numbers**: Doing math with the computer\n- **User Input**: Making programs that respond to what users type\n- **Making Decisions**: Programs that can think (if statements)\n\n---\n\n## Summary Checklist\n\nBy now you should understand:\n- [ ] What a computer program is\n- [ ] What the Rust programming language is\n- [ ] How to install Rust on your computer\n- [ ] How to create a new project with `cargo new`\n- [ ] Every character in your first \"Hello, world!\" program\n- [ ] How to run your program with `cargo run`\n- [ ] What Cargo.toml is for\n- [ ] How to make simple changes to your program\n\nRemember: Programming is like learning a new language. It feels strange at first, but with practice, it becomes natural. Don't worry if you don't understand everything immediately - that's completely normal!\n\n---\n\n## Glossary of Terms\n\n- **Program**: A list of instructions for a computer\n- **Rust**: A programming language\n- **Function**: A named set of instructions (like a recipe)\n- **main**: The special function where programs start\n- **String**: Text wrapped in quotes\n- **Compile**: Translate human code into computer code\n- **Cargo**: Rust's helper tool for building projects\n- **Project**: A folder containing your program files\n- **Run**: Execute your program\n- **Terminal**: A text-based way to control your computer\n\n---\n\n*Congratulations on completing your first Rust lesson!

Like coin flips, each draw is independent and random, unaffected by any past results, so no predictable pattern can emerge.\n\n### How AI works  \nAI learns from large data sets and identifies patterns and correlations. This works only when the data contain exploitable regularities. Random lottery data have no such regularities; no matter how many historical draws an AI ingests, it cannot learn anything that will foretell the next winning combination.\n\n### The harm of believing AI can predict numbers  \nClaims that AI can forecast winning numbers foster gambling fantasies, lure people into overspending on tickets, disrupt personal finances, and can trigger family conflict or fraud—undermining the charitable purpose of lotteries.\n\n### Where AI is genuinely useful  \nAlthough AI cannot predict numbers, it can assist lottery operations: analyzing sales data to optimize retailer locations, detecting anomalous transactions to curb illegal sales, and helping maintain industry integrity.\n\nIn short, recognize AI’s limits, ignore false promises, treat lotteries rationally, and use AI only for what it can actually do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The character \"迸\" is pronounced as **bèng**."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "“迸” is pronounced **bèng**, fourth tone.\n\n**Definition**: Refers to sudden splitting, bursting, or splashing outward, as in “burst forth” (迸发), “crack open” (迸裂), or “sparks flying” (火星迸溅)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to pronounce \"瓮\""}], "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.6, "stream": true, "user": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "tools": [{"function": {"name": "search", "description": "Web Search API.

Here’s how it works.\n\nFirst, make sure to install the **aiosmtplib**.\n\nNow, here’s the script:\n\n**Quick breakdown**:\n\n-  **Asynchronous function definition**: The script now defines asynchronous functions using `async def`.\n\n-  **Async functionality**: Utilizing ‘asyncio and ‘aiosmtplib’, the script establishes an SMTP connection asynchronously, logs in, and sends the email. This approach allows for non-blocking email sending, which is particularly useful in applications that require maintaining responsiveness while performing network operations.\n\n-  **Running the script**: The `main` async function sets up the email details and calls send\\_email\\_async to send the email. It demonstrates how to run asynchronous tasks in Python effectively, with `asyncio.run(main())` bootstrapping the asynchronous execution.\n\n[搜索关键词]:email_processor.py implementation\n\n[编号]:[^3^]\n[标题]:Automating Emails with Python: A Comprehensive Guide\n[网站名称]:keentolearn.medium.com\n[日期]: 2023-02-14\n片段 1：\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nPhoto by Team Nocoloco on Unsplash\n\nEmail is a critical means of communication in today’s world, but it can be time-consuming and tedious to send out emails manually. Fortunately, Python provides a simple and efficient way to automate email sending and receiving tasks. In this article, we will explore how to use Python to automate emails, starting with the basics and moving on to more advanced techniques.\n\n## Getting started with Python’s built-in `smtplib` library\n\nThe simplest way to automate email sending in Python is by using the built-in `smtplib` library. The `smtplib` library is a powerful tool that allows you to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). To use the `smtplib` library, you must first set up an email account that can be used to send emails programmatically.\n\n## Sending email with Python\n\nOnce you have set up your email account, you can use Python to send emails. To send an email, you will need to import the `smtplib` library, create an instance of the `SMTP` class, log in to your email account, and send the email.\n\nHere’s an example code snippet that sends a simple email using Python:\n\n```\nimport smtplibsmtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'\nsmtp_port = 587\nsmtp_username = '[EMAIL]'\nsmtp_password = 'yourpassword'from_email = '[EMAIL]'\nto_email = '[EMAIL]'\nsubject = 'Hello, world!'\nbody = 'This is a test email.'message = f'Subject: {subject}\\n\\n{body}'with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as smtp:\n    smtp.starttls()\n    smtp.login(smtp_username, smtp_password)\n    smtp.sendmail(from_email, to_email, message)\n```\n\n-  This code sends an email from `[EMAIL]` to `[EMAIL]` with the subject \"Hello, world!\" and the body \"This is a test email.\"\n\n-  The `starttls()` method enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, which ensures that the email is transmitted securely.\n\n-  The `login()` method logs in to your email account using your username and password.\n\n-  Finally, the `sendmail()` method sends the email to the recipient.\n\n[搜索关键词]:email automation challenge requirements\n\n[编号]:[^4^]\n[标题]:Email marketing automation challenges and how businesses overcome them\n[网站名称]:okoone.com\n[日期]: 2024-02-01\n片段 1：\n## Establishing a culture of continuous testing and learning\n\nCMOs should experiment with different elements of email campaigns to determine what works best. Marketers can test subject lines, email designs, or send times, analyze the results, and use the insights gained to improve future emails for better performance.\n\nThe challenge here lies in executing rigorous testing protocols to validate the effectiveness of segmentation strategies. This means setting up A/B tests to determine the success of different email subject lines for different segments, for instance. The CMO must ensure that these tests yield meaningful data to inform future campaigns without exceeding budget constraints and while maintaining the brand’s integrity in a competitive environment that’s constantly in flux.\n\nFinally, establishing a culture of continuous testing and optimization is crucial. By implementing A/B testing protocols, marketers can assess the impact of different email subject lines on open rates and conversions. These tests should be designed to produce statistically significant results that can inform future campaigns. For example, if a test reveals that personalized subject lines significantly outperform generic ones, this insight can be used to tailor future emails. Training teams to understand and act on these insights keeps testing as a core part of the marketing strategy and not a rigid box-ticking exercise.\n\n[搜索关键词]:email_processor.py implementation\n\n[编号]:[^5^]\n[标题]:How to send emails in Python (with script examples) - MailerSend\n[网站名称]:mailersend.com\n[日期]: 2024-07-25\n片段 1：\n## How to send emails with Python\n\n### Sending emails in Python with an email API\n\nUsing a third-party email API is a great option if you want to create more advanced workflows with additional email-sending features and tracking options. MailerSend also provides an official Python SDK, making the implementation straightforward and efficient.\n\n**If you’d like to try this out MailerSend’s email API**, you can sign up for free and use a trial domain for testing purposes. It only takes a few minutes to sign up and you can start sending immediately.\n\n**To use the API:**\n\n1\\. Create an account for free and sign in.\n\n2\\. From the dashboard, click **Domains** in the left-hand menu. If you’d like to use your own domain, you can add one by clicking **Add domain**, or you can use the trial domain.\n\n3\\. Next to the domain you want to use, click **Manage**. In the API section, click **Generate new token**. A pop-up will appear, enter a recognizable name for your new API token, set the permissions, and then click **Create token**.\n\n4\\. Your API key will be generated and displayed. Make sure you copy and save it somewhere, or download it, as you won’t be able to access this again for security purposes.\n\nCheck out our API docs.\n\nTo get started, install MailerSend’s Python SDK in your Python app:\n\n```\n$ python -m pip install mailersend\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\nPython 3.6.1 or higher is required.\n\nYou’ll also need to install the _requests_ library to make HTTP requests to the MailerSend API:\n\n```\npip install requests\n```\n\nNext, we recommend using environment variables for your API key and other sensitive information to avoid exposing it in your code.\n\nYou can do this in your Terminal:\n\n```\nexport MAILERSEND_API_KEY=\"your_api_key\"\n```\n\nOr by creating a .env file with the following in your project directory:\n\n```\nMAILERSEND_API_KEY=your_api_key\n```\n\n[搜索关键词]:email_processor.py implementation\n\n[编号]:[^6^]\n[标题]:Send Emails Using Python - GeeksforGeeks\n[网站名称]:geeksforgeeks.org\n[日期]: 2024-06-17\n片段 1：\nLast Updated : 17 Jun, 2024\n\nBy using Python, you can send emails which can be a valuable skill for automation, communication, and data-driven processes.

// 需要 using System.Linq;\n    Console.WriteLine($\"First key: {first.Key}, value: {first.Value}\");\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ 注意事项\n\n- `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` 是**无序**的（虽然 .NET 中实现上是有序的，但不能依赖顺序）。\n- 如果你需要**顺序访问**，考虑使用 `OrderedDictionary` 或 `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`。\n- 如果你是从 JSON 反序列化得到的字典（如 `Dictionary<string, object>`），上述方法同样适用。\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 实际场景举例（反序列化 JSON）\n\n```csharp\nstring json = \"{\\\"foo\\\": 123, \\\"bar\\\": \\\"hello\\\"}\";\nvar dict = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Dictionary<string, object>>(json);\n\nforeach (var kvp in dict)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"{kvp.Key} => {kvp.Value}\");\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n如你有更具体的场景（比如嵌套字典、动态 key、从 JSON 解析等），可以继续问我。"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\"[{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-1c12-91bd-500f-cbed992ae6f8\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"12503150/4000A\\\"},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-4fb7-4de4-4bc4-0303a6cbffb1\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-4f83-49b0-256b-54014100e3b1\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-27a9-8f03-12f5-f49ee555ce04\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"\\\"}]\"\nC#，如何转化成正常数组"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "你这个字符串是**JSON 格式的数组**，每个元素是一个对象，包含 `\"key\"` 和 `\"value\"` 两个字段。要把它变成“正常数组”（比如 `Dictionary<string, string>` 或 `List<string>`），可以按以下方式处理：\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 目标 1：转成 `Dictionary<string, string>`（key → value）\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\nstring json = \"[{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-1c12-91bd-500f-cbed992ae6f8\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"12503150/4000A\\\"},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-4fb7-4de4-4bc4-0303a6cbffb1\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-4f83-49b0-256b-54014100e3b1\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"\\\"},{\\\"key\\\":\\\"00003a1b-27a9-8f03-12f5-f49ee555ce04\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"\\\"}]\";\n\n// 定义结构\nvar items = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<KeyValueItem>>(json);\n\n// 转成字典\nDictionary<string, string> dict = new();\nforeach (var item in items)\n{\n    dict[item.Key] = item.Value ?? string.Empty;\n}\n\n// 测试输出\nforeach (var kv in dict)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"{kv.Key} => {kv.Value}\");\n}\n\n// 辅助类\npublic class KeyValueItem\n{\n    public string Key { get;
